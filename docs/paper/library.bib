abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Flood early warning systems (FEWSs) rely on hydrological simulations driven by numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, both of which are inherently uncertain. Ensemble prediction systems (EPSs) address these uncertainties by generating multiple future scenarios. Discharge forecasts from EPS are converted into flood warnings by applying a set of criteria whose definition is crucial for the skill of the system. While meteorological and hydrological models are under continuous development, these warning criteria lack continuous evaluation. In this paper, we use discharge simulations from the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) to assess the skill of four NWPs—probabilistic and deterministic—and explore methods to create a grand ensemble that enhances overall skill. We examine the effects of the current warning criteria—probability threshold and persistence—optimize their values, and evaluate their effectiveness in smaller catchments. Our results indicate that probabilistic NWPs outperform deterministic models in flood warning skill and demonstrate that removing the persistence criterion from EPS enhances skill. Optimized warning criteria for a single probabilistic NWP boost EFAS skill by 6.6{\%} in terms of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}f{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} score, and a grand ensemble can further increase it by 4.1{\%}. We identify two effective grand ensemble methods—member based and skill based—and discuss their advantages and drawbacks. The improved criteria demonstrate comparable skill in catchments half the size of those currently used. In conclusion, our study presents a methodology for evaluating and refining the skill of multimodal FEWS, stressing the critical role of tailoring the flood warning criteria to the end users. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {In contrast to the traditional rainfall runoff modelling approaches, the rainfall-on-grid approaches do not require the specification of a node-link type representation of the catchment and its drainage network. Instead they use information from a digital elevation model and hydraulic modelling to define the drainage paths used by floodwaters on their way towards the catchment outlet. In the flatter parts of a catchment the drainage paths may thus change adaptively during a flood event. The catchment is represented by a large number of grid cells, each with its individual rainfall input and runoff output – in other words, the cells act as the equivalent to subareas in nodelink type models. However, the different scales of these basic catchment elements have important implications for the modelling of flood runoff, as they require different representations of the typical properties of the catchment elements. The non-linear nature of runoff generation means that the average response from many different small scale catchment elements cannot be expected to correspond to the lumped response of a subarea with average properties (e.g. a hillslope in a kinematic wave model). The rainfall-on-grid approaches can be applied in two ways: • the whole catchment is represented by a 2D grid,[7]},

The last two decades, for example, has seen a dramatic increase in the development and application of various types of AI approaches for stream-flow forecasting. Generally speaking, AI has exhibited significant progress in forecasting and modeling non-linear hydrological applications and in capturing the noise complexity in the dataset. This paper explores the state-of-the-art application of AI in stream-flow forecasting, focusing on defining the data-driven of AI, the advantages of complementary models, as well as the literature and their possible future application in modeling and forecasting stream-flow. The review also identifies the major challenges and opportunities for prospective research, including, a new scheme for modeling the inflow, a novel method for preprocessing time series frequency based on Fast Orthogonal Search (FOS) techniques, and Swarm Intelligence (SI) as an optimization approach.},

Moreover, characteristics of the data sets which may influence the model performance were also of interest. As a result, the Da River basin in Vietnam was chosen and two different combinations of input data sets from before 1985 (when the Hoa Binh dam was built) were used for one-day, two-day, and three-day flowrate forecasting ahead at Hoa Binh Station. The predictive ability of the model is quite impressive: The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) reached 99{\%}, 95{\%}, and 87{\%} corresponding to three forecasting cases, respectively. The findings of this study suggest a viable option for flood forecasting on the Da River in Vietnam, where the river basin stretches between many countries and downstream flows (Vietnam) may fluctuate suddenly due to flood discharge from upstream hydroelectric reservoirs.},

The DSS provides a series of recommendations for the quantity and timing of reservoir releases to optimize the economic value of the electrical energy produced, while balancing requirements and concerns related to flood control, environmental flows, and water supply.

To consider the backwater effect from this river, an enhanced tributary water level forecasting model is proposed by adding multiple water level data on the main river as input variables into the conventional ANN structure which often uses rainfall and upstream water level data. Four types of ANN models per each lead-time are built with increasing complexity of the input vector, and their performances are compared. The results indicate that the inclusion of multiple water level data on the main river to the network provides water level forecasts with greater accuracy at the Ogeumgyo gauging station of interest. The final best ANN models for water level forecasts with lead-times of 1 to 2 h show good performance with root mean square errors (RMSE) below 0.06 m and 0.12 m, respectively. However, the final best ANN model for forecasting 3 h ahead was unsatisfactory, showing underestimation at many rising parts of the hydrograph.},

abstract = {The quality of precipitation forecasts from four Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models is evaluated over the Ovens catchment in Southeast Australia. Precipitation forecasts are compared with observed precipitation at point and catchment scales and at different temporal resolutions. The four models evaluated are the Australian Community Climate Earth-System Simulator (ACCESS) including ACCESS-G with a 80 km resolution, ACCESS-R 37.5 km, ACCESS-A 12 km, and ACCESS-VT 5 km. The skill of the NWP precipitation forecasts varies considerably between rain gauging stations. In general, high spatial resolution (ACCESS-A and ACCESS-VT) and regional (ACCESS-R) NWP models overestimate precipitation in dry, low elevation areas and underestimate in wet, high elevation areas. The global model (ACCESS-G) consistently underestimates the precipitation at all stations and the bias increases with station elevation. The skill varies with forecast lead time and, in general, it decreases with the increasing lead time. When evaluated at finer spatial and temporal resolution (e.g. 5 km, hourly), the precipitation forecasts appear to have very little skill. There is moderate skill at short lead times when the forecasts are averaged up to daily and/or catchment scale. The precipitation forecasts fail to produce a diurnal cycle shown in observed precipitation. Significant sampling uncertainty in the skill scores suggests that more data are required to get a reliable evaluation of the forecasts. The non-smooth decay of skill with forecast lead time can be attributed to diurnal cycle in the observation and sampling uncertainty. Future work is planned to assess the benefits of using the NWP rainfall forecasts for short-term streamflow forecasting. Our findings here suggest that it is necessary to remove the systematic biases in rainfall forecasts, particularly those from low resolution models, before the rainfall forecasts can be used for streamflow forecasting. {\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s).},

The prototype covers the whole of Europe on a 5 km grid. In parallel, different high-resolution data sets have been collected for the Elbe and Danube river basins, allowing the potential of the system under optimum conditions and on a higher resolution to be assessed. Flood warning lead-times of 3ĝ€"10 days are achieved through the incorporation of medium-range weather forecasts from the German Weather Service (DWD) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), comprising a full set of 51 probabilistic forecasts from the Ensemble Prediction System (EPS) provided by ECMWF. The ensemble of different hydrographs is analysed and combined to produce early flood warning information, which is disseminated to the hydrological services that have agreed to participate in the development of the system.

abstract = {Flood risk mitigation during real-time flood events comprising snowmelt under hydrological uncertainty is particularly challenging. Giving this due consideration, the aim is to develop a Decision Support System (DSS) for the real-time operation of a reservoir and the channel downstream. This was accomplished with continuous catchment monitoring, runoff forecasting, optimal reservoir decisions, river, and flood inundation analysis. The proposed DSS consists of four major components: (1) Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for real-time monitoring; (2) Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC) – Hydrological Modelling System (HMS) to simulate rainfall/snowmelt runoff process; (3) HEC – Reservoir Simulation System (ResSim) for operation of the controlled reservoir; and (4) HEC – River Analysis System (RAS) for two-dimensional unsteady river analysis and flood inundation mapping. After the DSS is set up, a real-time operation for an extreme case scenario was simulated to test the performance, and flood maps were generated. Yuvacık Dam Basin in Turkey has a robust gauge network but is rather limited in reservoir storage and downstream channel capacity. This is the basis for selection of the area in the study. Results show that the developed DSS is useful for forecasting and reservoir operations, in addition to serving as an early warning system.},

abstract = {Numerical weather forecasts, such as meteorological forecasts of precipitation, are inherently uncertain. These uncertainties depend on model physics as well as initial and boundary conditions. Since precipitation forecasts form the input into hydrological models, the uncertainties of the precipitation forecasts result in uncertainties of flood forecasts. In order to consider these uncertainties, ensemble prediction systems are applied. These systems consist of several members simulated by different models or using a single model under varying initial and boundary conditions. However, a too wide uncertainty range obtained as a result of taking into account members with poor prediction skills may lead to underestimation or exaggeration of the risk of hazardous events. Therefore, the uncertainty range of model-based flood forecasts derived from the meteorological ensembles has to be restricted. In this paper, a methodology towards improving flood forecasts by weighting ensemble members according to their skills is presented. The skill of each ensemble member is evaluated by comparing the results of forecasts corresponding to this member with observed values in the past. Since numerous forecasts are required in order to reliably evaluate the skill, the evaluation procedure is time-consuming and tedious. Moreover, the evaluation is highly subjective, because an expert who performs it makes his decision based on his implicit knowledge. Therefore, approaches for the automated evaluation of such forecasts are required. Here, we present a semi-automated approach for the assessment of precipitation forecast ensemble members. The approach is based on supervised machine learning and was tested on ensemble precipitation forecasts for the area of the Mulde river basin in Germany. Based on the evaluation results of the specific ensemble members, weights corresponding to their forecast skill were calculated. These weights were then successfully used to reduce the uncertainties within rainfall-runoff simulations and flood risk predictions.},

Such global hazard maps can be generated using large scale physically based models of rainfall-runoff and river routing, when used in conjunction with a number of post-processing methods. In this study, the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) land surface model is coupled to ERA-Interim reanalysis meteorological forcing data, and resultant runoff is passed to a river routing algorithm which simulates floodplains and flood flow across the global land area. The global hazard map is based on a 30 yr (1979-2010) simulation period. A Gumbel distribution is fitted to the annual maxima flows to derive a number of flood return periods. The return periods are calculated initially for a 25 {\&}times; 25 km grid, which is then reprojected onto a 1 {\&}times; 1 km grid to derive maps of higher resolution and estimate flooded fractional area for the individual 25 {\&}times; 25 km cells. Several global and regional maps of flood return periods ranging from 2 to 500 yr are presented. The results compare reasonably to a benchmark data set of global flood hazard. The developed methodology can be applied to other datasets on a global or regional scale. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {Computer simulation models have been widely used to generate hydrometeorological forecasts. As the raw forecasts contain uncertainties arising from various sources, including model inputs and outputs, model initial and boundary conditions, model structure, and model parameters, it is necessary to apply statistical postprocessing methods to quantify and reduce those uncertainties. Different postprocessing methods have been developed for meteorological forecasts (e.g., precipitation) and for hydrological forecasts (e.g., streamflow) due to their different statistical properties. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of the commonly used statistical postprocessing methods for both meteorological and hydrological forecasts. Moreover, methods to generate ensemble members that maintain the observed spatiotemporal and intervariable dependency are reviewed. Finally, some perspectives on the further development of statistical postprocessing methods for hydrometeorological ensemble forecasting are provided.

This study evaluates streamflow forecasts using a process-based model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool-Variable Source Area model-SWAT-VSA), a stochastic model (Artificial Neural Network -ANN), an Auto-Regressive Moving-Average (ARMA) model, and a Bayesian ensemble model that utilizes the SWAT-VSA, ANN, and ARMA results. Streamflow is forecast from 1 to 8 d, forced with Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts from the US National Weather Service. Of the individual models, SWAT-VSA and the ANN provide better predictions of total streamflow (NSE 0.60–0.70) and peak flow, but underpredicted low flows. During the forecast period the ANN had the highest predictive power (NSE 0.44–0.64), however all three models underpredicted peak flow. The Bayesian ensemble forecast streamflow with the most skill for all forecast lead times (NSE 0.49–0.67) and provided a quantification of prediction uncertainty.},

abstract = {In contrast to the traditional rainfall runoff modelling approaches, the rainfall-on-grid approaches do not require the specification of a node-link type representation of the catchment and its drainage network. Instead they use information from a digital elevation model and hydraulic modelling to define the drainage paths used by floodwaters on their way towards the catchment outlet. In the flatter parts of a catchment the drainage paths may thus change adaptively during a flood event. The catchment is represented by a large number of grid cells, each with its individual rainfall input and runoff output – in other words, the cells act as the equivalent to subareas in nodelink type models. However, the different scales of these basic catchment elements have important implications for the modelling of flood runoff, as they require different representations of the typical properties of the catchment elements. The non-linear nature of runoff generation means that the average response from many different small scale catchment elements cannot be expected to correspond to the lumped response of a subarea with average properties (e.g. a hillslope in a kinematic wave model). The rainfall-on-grid approaches can be applied in two ways: • the whole catchment is represented by a 2D grid,[7]},

This benefit pushes Himachal Pradesh to build more and more dams to generate electricity, provide better irrigation supply to downstream areas and provide flood protection. To better utilize the huge potential of water, management of such reservoirs is the key issue. For this purpose, HEC-ResSim 3.1 is practiced on Pong Dam situated in western Himachal Pradesh. HEC-ResSim is one of the simulation models that possess single or multi-reservoir simulators and can simulate water resources systems. In this study, reservoir elevation and reservoir storage volume management is the target objective. The presented study was subsidized by daily observed data from 1998 up to 2014 of pool elevation, inflow, and outflow discharge. In addition, geometry and hydraulic data from dam and reservoir were employed to develop the platform to create a simulation using HEC-ResSim. Using the available reservoir data the simulation was performed for the 4 months of 2012. Then simulation results were compared with the real-time recorded data at the site. To validate the results, coefficient of determination for operations like reservoir elevation and reservoir storage was generated through regression plot and found more than 95{\%} accurate. Also, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was calculated for both reservoir elevation and reservoir storage simulation and found under an acceptable range. This paper shows the utility of HEC-ResSim 3.1 for reservoir operational management and also throws light on the further scope. Finally, there is a discussion of how useful is HEC-ResSim as a reservoir management tool and integration of HEC-ResSim 3.1 with other hydrologic monitoring systems.},

Predicted discharges are converted to water-level forecasts using the hydraulic model Iber+, a GPU-parallelized bidimensional flow model. Hydraulic models also assimilate tidal-level forecasts in order to define the boundary conditions of the models. The performance of MERLIN was evaluated over 4 months at three coastal catchments of 4.95, 16.96, and 83.9 km2.

abstract = {Seasonal climate forecasts produce probabilistic predictions of meteorological variables for subsequent months. This provides a potential resource to predict the influence of seasonal climate anomalies on surface water balance in catchments and hydro-thermodynamics in related water bodies (e.g., lakes or reservoirs). Obtaining seasonal forecasts for impact variables (e.g., discharge and water temperature) requires a link between seasonal climate forecasts and impact models simulating hydrology and lake hydrodynamics and thermal regimes. However, this link remains challenging for stakeholders and the water scientific community, mainly due to the probabilistic nature of these predictions. In this paper, we introduce a feasible, robust, and open-source workflow integrating seasonal climate forecasts with hydrologic and lake models to generate seasonal forecasts of discharge and water temperature profiles. The workflow has been designed to be applicable to any catchment and associated lake or reservoir, and is optimized in this study for four catchment-lake systems to help in their proactive management. We assessed the performance of the resulting seasonal forecasts of discharge and water temperature by comparing them with hydrologic and lake (pseudo)observations (reanalysis). Precisely, we analysed the historical performance using a data sample of past forecasts and reanalysis to obtain information about the skill (performance or quality) of the seasonal forecast system to predict particular events. We used the current seasonal climate forecast system (SEAS5) and reanalysis (ERA5) of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). We found that due to the limited predictability at seasonal time-scales over the locations of the four case studies (Europe and South of Australia), seasonal forecasts exhibited none to low performance (skill) for the atmospheric variables considered. Nevertheless, seasonal forecasts for discharge present some skill in all but one case study. Moreover, seasonal forecasts for water temperature had higher performance in natural lakes than in reservoirs, which means human water control is a relevant factor affecting predictability, and the performance increases with water depth in all four case studies. Further investigation into the skillful water temperature predictions should aim to identify the extent to which performance is a consequence of thermal inertia (i.e., lead-in conditions).},

abstract = {Ensemble streamflow predictions (ESPs) offer great potential benefits for water resource management, as they contain key probabilistic information for analyzing prediction uncertainty. Ensemble weather forecasts (EWFs) are usually incorporated into ESPs to provide climate information. However, there is no simple way to combine both of them, since EWFs are generally biased and under-dispersed. This study presents a new short-term (1 to 7 lead days) probabilistic streamflow prediction system combining stochastic weather generation and EWFs. The bias and under-dispersion of EWFs were first corrected using a weather generator-based post-processing approach (GPP). The corrected weather forecasts were then coupled with a hydrological model for streamflow forecasts. The proposed GPP forecast was compared against two other forecasts, one using the raw EWF (GFS), and the other using a stochastic weather generator (WG). The comparison was carried out over two Quebec watersheds, using a set of deterministic and probabilistic verification metrics. The deterministic metrics showed that the GPP forecast is consistently the best at predicting the ensemble mean streamflow for both watersheds and for all the leads ranging between 1 and 7 days, followed by the WG forecast. The probabilistic metrics showed negative or near zero skill retained by the GFS forecast for the first 7 lead days. The WG system was much more skillful than the GFS. The GPP forecast consistently displayed the highest skill and reliability in terms of all the metrics applied. With increasing lead days, the skill and reliability of the GPP forecast tend to converge toward that of the WG forecast, indicating that the short-term GPP forecast could easily be linked to a pure WG forecast to extend the forecast horizon.},

This is the first LSTM application on Danish data. The results were benchmarked against the Danish national water resources model (DK-model), a physically based hydrological model. The median Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), a common metric to assess performance of runoff predictions (optimum of 1), increased from 0.7 (DK-model) to 0.8 (LSTM) when trained against all catchments. Overall, the LSTM outperformed the DK-model in 80{\%} of catchments. Despite the compelling KGE evaluation, the water balance closure was modelled less accurately by the LSTM. The applicability of LSTM networks for modelling ungauged catchments was assessed via a spatial split-sample experiment. A 20{\%} spatial hold-out showed poorer performance of the LSTM with respect to the DK model. However, after pre-training, that is, weight initialisation obtained from training against simulated data from the DK-model, the performance of the LSTM was effectively improved. This formed a convincing argument supporting the knowledge-guided machine learning (ML) paradigm to integrate physically based models and ML to train robust models that generalise well.},

abstract = {Numerical weather forecasts, such as meteorological forecasts of precipitation, are inherently uncertain. These uncertainties depend on model physics as well as initial and boundary conditions. Since precipitation forecasts form the input into hydrological models, the uncertainties of the precipitation forecasts result in uncertainties of flood forecasts. In order to consider these uncertainties, ensemble prediction systems are applied. These systems consist of several members simulated by different models or using a single model under varying initial and boundary conditions. However, a too wide uncertainty range obtained as a result of taking into account members with poor prediction skills may lead to underestimation or exaggeration of the risk of hazardous events. Therefore, the uncertainty range of model-based flood forecasts derived from the meteorological ensembles has to be restricted. In this paper, a methodology towards improving flood forecasts by weighting ensemble members according to their skills is presented. The skill of each ensemble member is evaluated by comparing the results of forecasts corresponding to this member with observed values in the past. Since numerous forecasts are required in order to reliably evaluate the skill, the evaluation procedure is time-consuming and tedious. Moreover, the evaluation is highly subjective, because an expert who performs it makes his decision based on his implicit knowledge. Therefore, approaches for the automated evaluation of such forecasts are required. Here, we present a semi-automated approach for the assessment of precipitation forecast ensemble members. The approach is based on supervised machine learning and was tested on ensemble precipitation forecasts for the area of the Mulde river basin in Germany. Based on the evaluation results of the specific ensemble members, weights corresponding to their forecast skill were calculated. These weights were then successfully used to reduce the uncertainties within rainfall-runoff simulations and flood risk predictions.},

abstract = {The purpose of an early warning system (EWS) is to issue warning signals prior to extreme events. Extreme weather events, however, are hard to predict due to their chaotic behavior. This paper suggests a method for an effective EWS for very short-term heavy rainfall with machine learning techniques. The EWS produces a warning signal when it is expected to reach the criterion for a heavy rain advisory within the next 3 h. We devised a selective discretization method that converts a subset of continuous input variables to nominal ones. Meteorological data obtained from automatic weather stations are preprocessed by the selective discretization and principal component analysis. As a classifier, logistic regression is used to predict whether or not a warning is required. A comparative evaluation was performed on the EWS models generated by various classifiers. The tests were run for 652 locations in South Korea from 2007 to 2012. The empirical results showed that the preprocessing methods improved the prediction quality and logistic regression works well on heavy rainfall nowcasting in terms of F-measure and equitable threat score.},

abstract = {A novel multiscale postprocessor for ensemble streamflow prediction, MS-EnsPost, is described and comparatively evaluated with the existing postprocessor in the National Weather Service's Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast Service, EnsPost. MS-EnsPost uses data-driven correction of magnitude-dependent bias in simulated flow, multiscale regression using observed and simulated flows over a range of temporal aggregation scales, and ensemble generation using parsimonious error modeling. For comparative evalu-ation, 139 basins in eight River Forecast Centers in the United States were used. Streamflow predictability in different hydroclimatological regions is assessed and characterized, and gains by MS-EnsPost over EnsPost are attributed. The ensemble mean and ensemble prediction results indicate that, compared to EnsPost, MS-EnsPost reduces the root-mean-square error and mean continuous ranked probability score of day-1 to day-7 predictions of mean daily flow by 5{\%}–68{\%} and by 2{\%}–62{\%}, respectively. The deterministic and probabilistic results indicate that for most basins the improvement by MS-EnsPost is due to both magnitude-dependent bias correction and full utilization of hydrologic memory through multiscale regression. Comparison of the continuous ranked probability skill score results with hydroclimatic indices indicates that the skill of ensemble streamflow prediction with post processing is modulated largely by the fraction of precipitation as snowfall and, for non-snow-driven basins, mean annual precipitation.},

abstract = {Hydrological models used for flood prediction in ungauged catchments are commonly fitted to regionally transferred data. The key issue of this procedure is to identify hydrologically similar catchments. Therefore, the dominant controls for the process of interest have to be known. In this study, we applied a new machine learning based approach to identify the catchment characteristics that can be used to identify the active processes controlling runoff dynamics. A random forest (RF) regressor has been trained to estimate the drainage velocity parameters of a geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph (GIUH) in ungauged catchments, based on regionally available data. We analyzed the learning procedure of the algorithm and identified preferred donor catchments for each ungauged catchment. Based on the obtained machine learning results from catchment grouping, a classification scheme for drainage network characteristics has been derived. This classification scheme has been applied in a flood forecasting case study. The results demonstrate that the RF could be trained properly with the selected donor catchments to successfully estimate the required GIUH parameters. Moreover, our results showed that drainage network characteristics can be used to identify the influence of geomorphological dispersion on the dynamics of catchment response.},

@article{Hidayat2014,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers. Discharge predictions at tidally affected river reaches are currently still a great challenge in hydrological practices. In tidal rivers, water levels are not uniquely a function of streamflow. Here, the possibility to predict discharge from water level information from gauge stations at sea and in the river is explored. A hindcast model is established for a tide-dominated lowland site along the Mahakam River (East Kalimantan, Indonesia), using an artificial neural network (ANN) model. The input data for the ANN are gradually increased, by adding new input data in each step. The results show that the inclusion of data from tide predictions at sea leads to an improved model performance. The optimized ANN-based hindcast model produces a good discharge estimation, as shown by a consistent performance during both the training and validation periods. Using this model, discharge can be predicted from astronomical tidal predictions at sea plus water level measurements from a single station at an upstream location. Alternatively, the ANN model can be used as a tool for data gap filling in a disrupted discharge time-series based on a horizontal acoustic Doppler current profiler (H-ADCP). A forecast model is developed for the same river site that is located near the city of Samarinda. To this end, water level data, predicted tide levels, and at-site historical data are considered as input for the model. The discharge time-series derived from H-ADCP data are used for calibration and validation of the multistep ahead discharge forecast model. A good performance is obtained for predictions with a forecast lead time up to two days.},

abstract = {Nariables simulated by climate models are usually evaluated independently. Yet, climate change impacts often stem from the combined effect of these variables, making the evaluation of intervariable relationships essential. These relationships can be evaluated in a statistical framework (e.g., using correlation coefficients), but this does not test whether complex processes driven by nonlinear relationships are correctly represented. To overcome this limitation, we propose to evaluate climate model simulations in a more process-oriented framework using hydrological modeling. Our modeling chain consists of 12 regional climate models (RCMs) from the Coordinated Downscaling Experiment-European Domain (EURO-CORDEX) forced by five general circulation models (GCMs), eight Swiss catchments, 10 optimized parameter sets for the hydrological model Hydrologiska Byr{\aa}ns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV), and one bias correction method [quantile mapping (QM)]. We used seven discharge metrics to explore the representation of different hydrological processes under current climate. Specific combinations of biases in GCM-RCM simulations can lead to significant biases in simulated discharge (e.g., excessive precipitation in the winter months combined with a cold temperature bias). Other biases, such as exaggerated snow accumulation, do not necessarily impact temperature over the historical period to the point where discharge is affected. Our results confirm the importance of bias correction; when all catchments, GCM-RCMs, and discharge metrics were considered, QM improved discharge simulations in the vast majority of all cases. Additionally, we present a ranking of climate models according to their hydrological performance. Ranking GCM-RCMs is most meaningful prior to bias correction since QM reduces differences between GCM-RCM-driven hydrological simulations. Overall, this work introduces a multivariate assessment method of GCM-RCMs, which enables a more process-oriented evaluation of their simulations.},

abstract = {Short-term operation of reservoir systems is challenging due to conflicting objectives and constraints as well as the need for taking robust decisions in real-time. This study compares simulation and optimization based decision support techniques in application to the mitigation of flood events. Two models are employed in the study to support the operators' decisions: (1) HEC-ResSim of USACE as a representative of a simulation-based approach, and (2) the RTC-Tools package of Deltares with an optimization approach. The methods are applied to a complex flood management problem at Yuvacik Dam, Turkey. A worst case scenario of an extreme flood event is used to evaluate the pros and cons of the models including a high initial water level exceeding the flood control pool. Objectives of the control are the maximization of water supply benefits, i.e. a full reservoir, at the end of the event as well as flood mitigation in the downstream river reach. In the first method, a script-based rule is defined in the GUI with user access to its parameters. The refinement of the reservoir operation is conducted manually by trial and error. Secondly, an optimization approach using Model Predictive Control (MPC) is used in combination with the IPOPT optimizer. The advantage of HEC-ResSim is the detailed representation of the gate management on the level of the individual gates. However, the implementation of the total release is partially up to user interaction and not necessarily optimal. RTC-Tools provides optimum releases on the project level, but not on the level of individual gates. Both approaches consider system constraints. Furthermore, an advantage of the optimization approach is its extension to probabilistic ensemble forecasts to consider forecast uncertainty in the decision by use stochastic optimization.},

abstract = {Although ensemble prediction systems (EPS) are increasingly promoted as the scientific state-of-the-art for operational flood forecasting, the communication, perception, and use of the resulting alerts have received much less attention. Using a variety of qualitative research methods, including direct user feedback at training workshops, participant observation during site visits to 25 forecasting centres across Europe, and in-depth interviews with 69 forecasters, civil protection officials, and policy makers involved in operational flood risk management in 17 European countries, this article discusses the perception, communication, and use of European Flood Alert System (EFAS) alerts in operational flood management. In particular, this article describes how the design of EFAS alerts has evolved in response to user feedback and desires for a hydrographic-like way of visualizing EFAS outputs. It also documents a variety of forecaster perceptions about the value and skill of EFAS forecasts and the best way of using them to inform operational decision making. EFAS flood alerts were generally welcomed by flood forecasters as a sort of 'pre-alert' to spur greater internal vigilance. In most cases, however, they did not lead, by themselves, to further preparatory action or to earlier warnings to the public or emergency services. Their hesitancy to act in response to medium-term, probabilistic alerts highlights some wider institutional obstacles to the hopes in the research community that EPS will be readily embraced by operational forecasters and lead to immediate improvements in flood incident management. The EFAS experience offers lessons for other hydrological services seeking to implement EPS operationally for flood forecasting and warning. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

As a semi-distributed macroscale hydrological model, VIC balances both the water and surface energy within the grid cell; and its sub-grid variations are captured statistically. Distinguishing characteristics of the VIC model include: subgrid variability in land surface vegetation classes; subgrid variability in the soil moisture storage capacity; drainage from the lower soil moisture zone (base flow) as a nonlinear recession; and the inclusion of topography that allows for orographic precipitation and temperature lapse rates resulting in more realistic hydrology in mountainous regions. VIC uses a separate routing model based on a linear transfer function to simulate the streamflow. Adaptations to the routing model are implemented in VIC to allow representation of water management effects including reservoir operation and irrigation diversions and return flows. Since its existence, VIC has been well calibrated and validated in a number of large river basins over the continental US and the globe. Applications using the VIC model cover a variety of research areas. Given the numerous improvements and updates of the VIC model through its nearly twenty years of existence, this document serves as a general guideline for helping users of the long term dataset to understand the fundamental VIC algorithms up to date. Section 1 serves as an introduction, Section 2 gives a historical overview of the VIC model development, and Section 3 explains the classic algorithms of the VIC model for calculating the state variables, surface fluxes, and streamflow, as well as the newly implemented algorithms for taking into account the water management.

abstract = {A merging of a conceptual hydrological model with two vegetation models is performed to improve the ability to simultaneously predict catchment scale streamflow and vegetation dynamics (represented by the Leaf Area Index, LAI). A modeling study is performed across 27 catchments of 90-1600km2 in the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia. Validation results from the modeling exercise show that the merged ecohydrological models were capable of improving streamflow prediction compared to hydrological models alone, while also providing as good estimates of LAI as dynamic vegetation models alone. It was shown that a single-objective optimization could independently produce good estimates of streamflow and LAI, but the other un-calibrated predicted outcome (LAI if streamflow was the focus of the optimization and vice versa) was consistently compromised. In essence, single-objective optimization has limited capacity to represent the multi-response dynamics in conceptual ecohydrological models. However, using multi-objective optimization, good predictions for both streamflow and LAI are obtained. Our results illustrate that the multi-objective optimization provides a balanced solution for multivariate responses and gives better representation of streamflow and LAI dynamics. It is suggested that further development of this approach in terms of conceptual model design and optimization techniques could lead to greatly improved ecohydrological modeling and applications.},

abstract = {Regionalization approaches to daily streamflow prediction are investigated for 13 catchments in the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model of low complexity (six parameters). Model parameters are considered to represent the dynamic response characteristics (DRCs) of a catchment. It is demonstrated that all catchments within the region cannot be assumed to have a similar hydrological behaviour, and thence a regionalization approach considering differences in physical catchment descriptors (PCDs) is required. Such a regionalization approach can be regarded as a top-down method, in the sense that factors controlling parameter variability are identified first within the entire region under study, and then such information is exploited to predict runoff in a smaller sub-region. Regionalization results reveal that consideration of interrelations between dependent variables, which here are the parameters of the rainfall-runoff model, can improve performance of regression as a regionalization method. Breaking the parameter correlation structure inherent in the model, and exploiting merely relationships between model parameters and PCDs (no matter how weakly related they are), can result in a significant decrease in regionalization performance. Also, high significance of regression between values of PCDs and DRCs does not guarantee a set of parameters with a good predictive power. When there is a reason to believe that, in the sense of hydrological behaviour, a gauged catchment resembles the ungauged catchment, then it may be worthwhile to adopt the entire set of calibrated parameters from the gauged catchment instead of deriving quantitative relationships between catchment descriptors and model parameters.

abstract = {Recent advances in meteorological forecast skill now enable significantly improved estimates of precipitation quantity, timing and spatial distribution to be made up to 10 days ahead for model scales of 40 km in forecast mode. Here we outline a prototype methodology to downscale these precipitation estimates using regional Numerical Weather Prediction models to spatial scales appropriate to hydrological forecasting and then use these to drive high-resolution scale (1 or 5 km grid scale) water balance and rainfall-runoff models. The aim is to develop a European Flood Forecasting System (EFFS) and determine what flood forecast skill can be achieved for given basins, meteorological events and prediction products. The output from the system is a probabilistic assessment of n-day ahead discharge exceedence risk (where n {\textless} 10) for the whole of Europe at 5 km resolution which may then be updated as the forecast lead time reduces. At each stage the discharge estimates can be used to drive detailed (25-100 m resolution) hydraulic models to estimate the flood inundation which may potentially occur. Initial results are presented from a prototype version of the system used to perform a hindcast of the January 1995 flooding events in NW-Europe (Rhine, Meuse). {\textcopyright} 2003 by Taylor nad Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Accurate hydrological modeling is vital to characterizing how the terrestrial water cycle responds to climate change. Pure deep learning (DL) models have shown to outperform process-based ones while remaining difficult to interpret. More recently, differentiable, physics-informed machine learning models with a physical backbone can systematically integrate physical equations and DL, predicting untrained variables and processes with high performance. However, it was unclear if such models are competitive for global-scale applications with a simple backbone. Therefore, we use – for the first time at this scale – differentiable hydrologic models (fullname $\delta$HBV-globe1.0-hydroDL and shorthanded $\delta$HBV) to simulate the rainfall-runoff processes for 3753 basins around the world. Moreover, we compare the $\delta$HBV models to a purely data-driven long short-term memory (LSTM) model to examine their strengths and limitations. Both LSTM and the $\delta$HBV models provide competent daily hydrologic simulation capabilities in global basins, with median Kling-Gupta efficiency values close to or higher than 0.7 (and 0.78 with LSTM for a subset of 1675 basins with long-term records), significantly outperforming traditional models. Moreover, regionalized differentiable models demonstrated stronger spatial generalization ability (median KGE 0.64) than a traditional parameter regionalization approach (median KGE 0.46) and even LSTM for ungauged region tests in Europe and South America. Nevertheless, relative to LSTM, the differentiable model was hampered by structural deficiencies for cold or polar regions, and highly arid regions, and basins with significant human impacts. This study also sets the benchmark for hydrologic estimates around the world and builds foundations for improving global hydrologic simulations.},

abstract = {Availability of free, high quality Landsat data portends a new era in remote sensing change detection. Using dense ({\~{}}. annual) Landsat time series (LTS), we can now characterize vegetation change over large areas at an annual time step and at the spatial grain of anthropogenic disturbance. Additionally, we expect more accurate detection of subtle disturbances and improved characterization in terms of both timing and intensity. For Landsat change detection in this new era of dense LTS, new detection algorithms are required, and new approaches are needed to calibrate those algorithms and to examine the veracity of their output. This paper addresses that need by presenting a new tool called TimeSync for syncing algorithm and human interpretations of LTS. The tool consists of four components: (1) a chip window within which an area of user-defined size around an area of interest (i.e., plot) is displayed as a time series of image chips which are viewed simultaneously, (2) a trajectory window within which the plot spectral properties are displayed as a trajectory of Landsat band reflectance or index through time in any band or index desired, (3) a Google Earth window where a recent high-resolution image of the plot and its neighborhood can be viewed for context, and (4) an Access database where observations about the LTS for the plot of interest are entered. In this paper, we describe how to use TimeSync to collect data over forested plots in Oregon and Washington, USA, examine the data collected with it, and then compare those data with the output from a new LTS algorithm, LandTrendr, described in a companion paper (Kennedy et al., 2010). For any given plot, both TimeSync and LandTrendr partitioned its spectral trajectory into linear sequential segments. Depending on the direction of spectral change associated with any given segment in a trajectory, the segment was assigned a label of disturbance, recovery, or stable. Each segment was associated with a start and end vertex which describe its duration. We explore a variety of ways to summarize the trajectory data and compare those summaries derived from both TimeSync and LandTrendr. One comparison, involving start vertex date and segment label, provides a direct linkage to existing change detection validation approaches that rely on contingency (error) matrices and kappa statistics. All other comparisons are unique to this study, and provide a rich set of means by which to examine algorithm veracity. One of the strengths of TimeSync is its flexibility with respect to sample design, particularly the ability to sample an area of interest with statistical validity through space and time. This is in comparison to the use of existing reference data (e.g., field or airphoto data), which, at best, exist for only parts of the area of interest, for only specific time periods, or are restricted thematically. The extant data, even though biased in their representation, can be used to ascertain the veracity of TimeSync interpretation of change. We demonstrate that process here, learning that what we cannot see with TimeSync are those changes that are not expressed in the forest canopy (e.g., pre-commercial harvest or understory burning) and that these extant reference datasets have numerous omissions that render them less than desirable for representing truth. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {Hydrological model evaluation and identification essentially involves extracting and processing information from model time series. However, the type of information extracted by statistical measures has only very limited meaning because it does not relate to the hydrological context of the data. To overcome this inadequacy we exploit the diagnostic evaluation concept of Signature Indices, in which model performance is measured using theoretically relevant characteristics of system behaviour. In our study, a Self- Organizing Map (SOM) is used to process the Signatures extracted from Monte-Carlo simulations generated by the distributed conceptual watershed model NASIM. The SOM creates a hydrologically interpretable mapping of overall model behaviour, which immediately reveals deficits and trade-offs in the ability of the model to represent the different functional behaviours of the watershed. Further, it facilitates interpretation of the hydrological functions of the model parameters and provides preliminary information regarding their sensitivities. Most notably, we use this mapping to identify the set of model realizations (among the Monte-Carlo data) that most closely approximate the observed discharge time series in terms of the hydrologically relevant characteristics, and to confine the parameter space accordingly. Our results suggest that Signature Index based SOMs could potentially serve as tools for decision makers inasmuch as model realizations with specific Signature properties can be selected according to the purpose of the model application. Moreover, given that the approach helps to represent and analyze multi-dimensional distributions, it could be used to form the basis of an optimization framework that uses SOMs to characterize the model performance response surface. As such it provides a powerful and useful way to conduct model identification and model uncertainty analyses. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2009.},

annote = {Objectives

To analyse whether including model performance or forecast skill metrics in the EFAS' notification criteria would improve its accuracy (in terms of hit rate):

* To find the most interesting      metrics to add value to notifications.
* To determine how to include      those metrics in the notification.
* To study spatial      variations.

Data

EFAS v4.0 data for its first 5 months operating (oct-2020 to april-2021).

* Lists of formal (72) and      informal (48) flood notifications.
* Feedback received from users      on formal notifications (8).

Methods

The selected model performance metric is the modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE). Not all notifications have KGE available, since there are areas where there aren't stations available.
The forecast skill is measured by the Continuous ranked Probabilistic Skill Score (CRPSS). The benchmark is the model's climatology calculated over 30 years. Skill is analysed for lead times from 1 to 10 days.
In both cases, notifications are clustered in 4 groups according to the 3 quartiles.

Results

Model performace:

* Formal notifications. KGE and      correlation are useful as discriminatory tool.
* Informal notifications. Bias      produces the most useful results.
* Formal+informal notifications.      None of the metrics (KGE or its constituents) show a clear trend.

The spatial analysis doesn't cast any interesting results, apart from a lower performance in Southern Europe related with lack of stations and highly regulated rivers.

Forecast skill:

* Increasing CRPSS at issued lead time is not useful for improving the hit rate.

The spatial analysis doesn't provide clear results either.

Conclusions

* KGE can't be used a notification criteria since it is not available in some areas (Italy and Greece).
* CRPSS avoids this problem, but, since it's only based on modelled data, it doesn't take into      consideration reality.
* It is suggested to add performance (KGE) and skill (CRPSS) labelling, rather than criteria. In the case of CRPSS it should show the skill for the same lead time as the      notification.

Further research

* Collect more feedback.
* Repeat the analysis with larger amount of data. Now there is 2 years data.
* Missed events haven't been analyzed. To do so, it would be necessary to spot flood events that weren't notified by EFAS (floodlist, etc.). Increasing the heat rate should not come at the expense of a higher miss rate.
* To consider the possibility of removing the deterministic requirement for EFAS formal flood notifications (is it still applicable?).

Comments

He only analyses precision, i.e., the true positive rate: TP /      (TP + FP). Optimising precision means that when the system sends a flood notification, indeed a flood occurs. This may lead to underpredicting floods, since missed events are not taken into account in the optimization. To avoid missing flood events, other criteria such as recall should be applied: TP / (TP + FN). A compromise between these two criteria would be F1 of Fbeta scores, which are a trade-off between them.},

abstract = {Soil water uptake by plant roots results from the complex interplay between plant and soil which modulates and determines transport processes at a range of spatial and temporal scales: at small scales, uptake rates are determined by local soil and root hydraulic properties but, at the plant scale, local processes interact within the root system and are integrated through the hydraulic architecture of the root system and plant transpiration. However, because of the inherent complexity of the root system (both structural and functional), plant roots are commonly account for with synthetic but over-simplifying descriptors, valid at a given spatial scale. In this article, we present a model describing both soil and plant processes involved in water uptake at the scale of the whole root system with explicit account of individual roots. This is achieved through the unifying concepts of root system architecture and hydraulic continuity between the soil and plant. The model is based on a combination of architectural, root system hydraulic and soil water transfer modelling. The model can reproduce qualitatively and quantitatively laboratory experimental data obtained from imaging of water uptake by light transmission (cf. Garrigues et al., Water uptake by plant roots: I-Formation and propagation of a water extraction front in mature root systems as evidenced by 2D light transmission imaging. Plant and soil (2006, this issue) or X-ray imaging for two soil types (a sand/clay mix and a sandy clay loam) and different narrow-leaf lupin root systems (taprooted and fibrous), using independently measured soilplant parameters. Results of the experiments and modelling reported in this paper concur to show that a water extraction front formed on the root system. This uptake fronts spatial extension and propagation were closely related to the local dependence between root and soil hydraulic properties and root axial conductance. Hence, a sharp front formed in the sand/clay mix but was much more attenuated in the sandy loam. Comparison between taprooted and fibrous root systems grown in a sand/clay mix, show that the taprooted architecture induced a more spatially concentrated uptake zone (near the soil surface) with higher flux rates, but with xylem water potential at the base of the root system twice as low than in the fibrous architecture. Modelling provided evidence that hydraulic lift might have occurred when transpiration declined, particularly in soil prone to abrupt variations in soil water potential (sand/clay mix). Finally, such a model, explicitly coupling root system-soil water transfers, can be useful to study water uptake in relation with root architectural traits, distribution of root hydraulic conductance or influence of heterogeneous conditions (localised irrigation, root clumping).},

abstract = {Integrating reservoir flood control operations in global flood forecasting systems is important for accurately estimating discharge and other variables. Because existing modeling operational rules and parameters do not reflect the actual variability due to a lack of associated data, globally applicable modeling of flood regulation needs to be studied further. In this study, we developed a flood control operation scheme with refined parameters and algorithms to tackle this problem. We used recently developed objective data sets of reservoir dynamics to more realistically estimate different reservoir parameters, such as flood storage capacity. Furthermore, the algorithm for the operational rule was modified by introducing a new release coefficient such that the peak attenuation depended on the reservoir's ability to regulate floods. The operation scheme for 2,169 dams was introduced into the CaMa-Flood global hydrodynamic model. Compared to the simulation without reservoirs, the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency and peak discharge error in the daily river discharge improved at 62.2{\%} and 49.9{\%} of the gauges, respectively, after the integration. Compared to the parameter estimated by a method in previous studies, the newly estimated flood storage capacity parameters reduced the peak discharge error at 47{\%} of the gauges downstream of the reservoirs where the flood storage capacity ratio is small (≤50{\%}). Furthermore, the modification of operational rules had the effect of mitigating people exposed to flooding by ∼10{\%}. This study informs the integration and the refinements of the reservoir operation scheme to improve global flood simulation and forecasting.},

abstract = {Spatially distributed hydrological models are traditionally calibrated and evaluated against few spatially aggregated observations such as river discharge. This model evaluation approach does not enable an assessment of the model predictive capabilities of other hydrological states and fluxes nor does it give any insight into the model ability to mimic the spatial patterns within a catchment. The current study explores a multivariable optimization of a complex coupled surface–subsurface–atmosphere model at the catchment scale in an attempt to move beyond simple run-off calibration. The model is evaluated against five independent observational data sets of discharge (Q), hydraulic head (h), actual evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture (SM), and remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST). It is shown that a balanced optimization can be achieved where errors on objective functions for all five observation data sets can be reduced simultaneously. Additionally, the multivariable calibration proved more robust, compared with calibration against Q and h only, during the validation period, even for Q and h. The current parameterization and calibration framework was mainly suitable for reducing model biases and allowed only limited improvements in the spatio-temporal patterns of the model simulations. This points towards development of better parametrization schemes that will allow simulated spatial patterns to adjust during calibration. Additionally, analysis showed that systematic spatial patterns in the errors of the LST maps could be a very valuable diagnostic tool for assessing deficiencies in the model structure, spatial parameterization, or process description.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A distributed model (TETIS), a semi-distributed model (TOPMODEL) and a lumped model (HEC HMS soil moisture accounting) were used to simulate the discharge response of a tropical high mountain basin characterized by soils with high water storage capacity and high conductivity. The models were calibrated with the Shuffle Complex Evolution algorithm, using the Kling and Gupta efficiency as objective function. Performance analysis and diagnostics were carried out using the signatures of the flow duration curve and through analysis of the model fluxes in order to identify the most appropriate model for the study area for flood early warning. The impact of varying grid sizes was assessed in the TETIS model and the TOPMODEL in order to chose a model with balanced model performance and computational efficiency. The sensitivity of the models to variation in the precipitation input was analysed by forcing the models with a rainfall ensemble obtained from Gaussian simulation. The resulting discharge ensembles of each model were compared in order to identify differences among models structures. The results show that TOPMODEL is the most realistic model of the three tested, albeit showing the largest discharge ensemble spread. The main differences among models occur between HEC HMS soil moisture accounting and TETIS, and HEC HMS soil moisture accounting and TOPMODEL, with HEC HMS soil moisture accounting producing ensembles in a range lower than the other two models. The ensembles of TETIS and TOPMODEL are more similar.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {A large part of the sediment in lowland rivers is transported as wash load. As wash load is a non-capacity load it often is modelled using empirical relations, such as the rating curve technique. Sediment rating curves in thee form of a power function are derived for several locations along the river Rhine and its main tributaries, using different fitting procedures. Inaccuracies in estimated sediment loads are analysed, and spatial differences in the shapes of the fitted rating curves are related to watershed characteristics. Rating curves obtained by least squares regression on logarithmic transformed data underestimate, long-term sediment transport rates by 10-50{\%}. Better estimates are obtained when nonlinear least squares regression is applied. The steepness of the fitted rating curves decreases along the main channel of the Rhine in a downstream direction. Contrary to what is generally believed this is not related to changes in the sediment transport regime. A better indication of the sediment transport regime is obtained when the slope/intercept pairs of the fitted rating curves are plotted in a graph. All locations that plot on the same line have a common discharge-concentration value and appear to be characterised by a similar sediment transport regime. At locations of which the slope/intercept pairs plot on higher lines, a larger part of the annual sediment load is transported during high discharge. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {We present a novel method for the direct determination of the snowmelt coefficient of widely used degree-day models, using only cumulated temperature and precipitation over the days of snow cover. We develop a proof of concept using (1) local measurements of precipitation, temperature and snow water equivalent (SWE) at a set of well-monitored sites in the US, and (2) available time series of snow cover from satellite and gridded daily precipitation and daily average temperature for the study region of South Tyrol, in the Italian Alps. We demonstrate how the method can reproduce the snow water balance to an acceptable extent, critically depending on the accuracy of input precipitation and temperature, highlighting the importance of a reliable representation of weather forcing if the estimate has to be robust and representative. Although not always accurate at a point, our approach yields a SWE reasonably consistent with observations, and snowmelt flows compatible with measured streamflow. At the same time, the model allows an interpretation of discrepancies between observations and simulations to detect inconsistencies between snow cover and weather forcing. This method is in principle applicable for large-scale hydrological assessments thanks to the increasing global coverage of snow cover, precipitation and temperature data. As the only other type of observation available to calibrate models is often streamflow, the direct calibration of the snow component of a model using snow cover and weather forcing reduces the number of model processes and parameters to be calibrated with streamflow, and is expected to increase model robustness.},

abstract = {Hydrological ensemble prediction systems (HEPSs) can provide decision makers with early warning information, such as peak stage and peak time, with enough lead time to take the necessary measures to mitigate disasters. This study develops a HEPS that integrates meteorological, hydrological, storm surge, and global tidal models. It is established to understand information about the uncertainty of numerical weather predictions and then to provide probabilistic flood forecasts instead of commonly adopted deterministic forecasts. The accuracy of flood forecasting is increased. However, the spatiotemporal uncertainty associated with these numerical models in the HEPS and the difficulty in interpreting the model results hinder effective decision-making during emergency response situations. As a result, the efficiency of decision-making is not always increased. Thus, this study also presents a visualization method to interpret the ensemble results to enhance the understanding of probabilistic runoff forecasts for operational purposes. A small watershed with area of 100 km2 and four historical typhoon events were selected to evaluate the performance of the method. The results showed that the proposed HEPS along with the visualization approach improved the intelligibility of forecasts of the peak stages and peak times compared to that of approaches previously described in the literature. The capture rate is greater than 50{\%}, which is considered practical for decision makers. The proposed HEPS with the visualization method has potential for both decreasing the uncertainty of numerical rainfall forecasts and improving the efficiency of decision-making for flood forecasts.},

abstract = {Clarification of the coupled ecohydrological mechanisms that determine the spatial pattern and structural characteristics of vegetation in water-limited landscapes remains a vexing problem in both hydrological and vegetation sciences. A particular challenge is the fact that the spatial pattern of vegetation is both a cause and effect of variation in water availability in semiarid ecosystems. Here we develop a methodology to derive the landscape- scale distribution of water balance and soil moisture in a patchy vegetation mosaic based on the statistics of an underlying poisson distribution of individual tree canopies and their accompanying root systems. We consider the dynamics of water balance at a point to be dependent on the number of intersecting tree root systems and overlapping tree canopies. The coupling of individual pattern to landscape- scale distribution of soil water balance allows for investigations into the role of tree density, average canopy size, and the lateral extension of tree root systems on the spatiotemporal patterns of soil moisture dynamics, plant water uptake, and plant stress in a wide range of open woodland ecosystems. Our model is applied to southern African savannas, and we find that locations in the landscape that contain average vegetation structure correspond to conditions of minimum stress across a wide range of annual rainfall and vegetation densities. Furthermore, observed vegetation structural parameters are consistent with an optimization that simultaneously maximizes plant water uptake while minimizing plant water stress. Finally, the model predicts adaptive changes in the optimal lateral extent of plant roots which decreases with increasing rainfall along a regional gradient in mean annual precipitation.},
annote = {Objetivo:
Desarrollar un modelo de la din{\'{a}}mica de la humedad del suelo aplicable a paisajes de vegetaci{\'{o}}n heterog{\'{e}}neos. Con ello se pretende generar un marco a partir del cual investigar las causas y efectos de la distribuci{\'{o}}n horizontal de la humedad del suelo y el stress h{\'{i}}drico en estructuras de vegetaci{\'{o}}n irregulares.

Teor{\'{i}}as e hip{\'{o}}tesis:
Patrones de vegetaci{\'{o}}n semi{\'{a}}ridos:
La distribuci{\'{o}}n de {\'{a}}rboles se representa mediante c{\'{i}}rculos a trav{\'{e}}s de un proceso de Poisson en 2D de par{\'{a}}metro $\lambda$t (n{\textordmasculine} centros/m²) que define su centro y una distribuci{\'{o}}n exponencial de media $\mu$r que define el radio de la copa. Las ra{\'{i}}ces son tambi{\'{e}}n c{\'{i}}rculos cuyo radio es el producto del radio de la copa y el par{\'{a}}metro at.
En funci{\'{o}}n de dichos par{\'{a}}emtros se define el n{\'{u}}mero medio de solapes de follaje (nc) y ra{\'{i}}ces (nr) y la probabilidad condicionada de que un punto del espacio tenga nc copas solapadas y nr ra{\'{i}}ces solapadas.

Probabilidad de la humedad del suelo (s):
Se define el balance de la humedad del suelo a trav{\'{e}}s de una ecuaci{\'{o}}n diferencial estoc{\'{a}}stica con un t{\'{e}}rmino de p{\'{e}}rdidas determin{\'{i}}stico. Esta ecuaci{\'{o}}n depende del n{\textordmasculine} de copas (nc) y ra{\'{i}}ces (nr). De su soluci{\'{o}}n se obtiene la distribuci{\'{o}}n de probabilidad de la humedad del suelo.
- El t{\'{e}}rmino de ganacias del equilibrio se compone de la precipitaci{\'{o}}n (proceso de poisson con intensidad seg{\'{u}}n una distribuci{\'{o}}n exponencial), la intercepci{\'{o}}n (se modifica la frecuencia del proceso de Poisson donde hay follaje) y la escorrent{\'{i}}a (al superar la saturaci{\'{o}}n del suelo).
- El t{\'{e}}rmino de p{\'{e}}rdidas se compone de la evaporaci{\'{o}}n directa del suelo (funci{\'{o}}n lineal de s por partes), la transpiraci{\'{o}}n (funci{\'{o}}n lineal de s por partes) y la percolaci{\'{o}}n (funci{\'{o}}n no lineal de s).
- Se tiene en cuenta el fraccionamiento de la energ{\'{i}}a entrante seg{\'{u}}n la que es absorbida por el follaje (y cada planta en concreto) y la que llega al suelo.

Metodolog{\'{i}}a:
1. Funciones de densidad de probabilidad: se derivan las pdf para las cuatro ubicaciones de estudio en el caso de no haber vegetaci{\'{o}}n o seg{\'{u}}n los par{\'{a}}metros de vegetaci{\'{o}}n observados.

2. Balance h{\'{i}}drico: se calculan los valores medios de cada t{\'{e}}rmino del balance para los cuatro paisajes.

3. Estr{\'{e}}s h{\'{i}}drico: se estudia el estr{\'{e}}s h{\'{i}}drico y la absorci{\'{o}}n de agua ponderada por el estr{\'{e}}s (agua absorbida bajo condiciones de estr{\'{e}}s tiene menos peso).
3.1 Se analizan tres estructuras de vegetaci{\'{o}}n (sin copas, la media observada, el doble de la media) para los cuatro paisajes.
3.2 Se representa la absorci{\'{o}}n ponderada para combinaciones de nr y nc.

4. Configuraciones {\'{o}}ptimas de paisaje: se estudia c{\'{o}}mo varia la media para cada paisaje de la aborci{\'{o}}n ponderada por el estr{\'{e}}s: 4.1 Al variar el coicente at; 4.2 Al variar la densidad de los {\'{a}}rboles $\lambda$t.

Resultados:
1. Funciones de distribuci{\'{o}}n de probabilidad: las fdp de suelo desnudo siguen el gradiente de precipitaci{\'{o}}n; las fdp con vegetaci{\'{o}}n son similares en los cuatro puntos. 
- La estructura de la vegetaci{\'{o}}n puede tratar de mantener una distribuci{\'{o}}n constante de la humedad del suelo justo por encima dle umbral de estr{\'{e}}s.

2. Balance h{\'{i}}drico: la percolaci{\'{o}}n es despreciable en los cuatro paisajes y la transpiraci{\'{o}}n cobra mayor importancia relativa en follajes m{\'{a}}s densos (mayor precipitaci{\'{o}}n).

3. Estr{\'{e}}s h{\'{i}}drico: 
3.1 La estructura de vegetaci{\'{o}}n media es la que genera menos estr{\'{e}}s.
3.2 - Los rangos de posibles estructuras aumentan al aumentar la densidad y tama{\~{n}}o de los {\'{a}}rboles (mayor precipitaci{\'{o}}n).
- El m{\'{a}}ximo de la abosrci{\'{o}}n ponderada para cada paisaje se obtiene para la misma combinaci{\'{o}}n de nc y nr. Los valores, en cambio, aumentan con la precipitaci{\'{o}}n.

4. Configuraciones {\'{o}}ptimas:
4.1 Existe un punto {\'{o}}ptimo de at (extensi{\'{o}}n de las ra{\'{i}}ces) para el que la absorci{\'{o}}n ponderada es m{\'{a}}xima. Dicho punto se desplaza radios menores de ra{\'{i}}z para precipitaci{\'{o}}n creciente (adaptaci{\'{o}}n).
4.2 Hay un punto {\'{o}}ptimo de la densidad de {\'{a}}rboles ($\lambda$t), creciente con la precipitaci{\'{o}}n. Dicho {\'{o}}ptimo coincide pr{\'{a}}cticamente con los valores medidos en los cuatro paisajes.

Limitaciones:
- En los datos e entrada, le porcentaje de cobertura arb{\'{o}}rea observado no concuerda con la predicci{\'{o}}n del paisaje de Poisson.

Preguntas sin respuesta:

- Siguiendo la primera limitaci{\'{o}}n, investigar el grado de agrupaci{\'{o}}n espacial de la humedad del suelo del paisaje evolucionando el presente modelo.},

abstract = {Forests exhibit strategies to cope with climate change; however, the rate of the changes on forests can be slower than the actual changes in environmental conditions. Forest management policies, such as assisted migration, may help forests to adapt their species distribution to changing climate conditions. Nonetheless, it certainly requires a better knowledge of cli- mate influences on trees to ensure the success of specific management actions. In this study, we apply dendroclimatological methods to investigate the growth response of the main forest species present in Moncayo Natural Park to climate to assess their current relationship and to model these responses over the potential distribution of each species across the study area. Our results revealed large differences in the response of beech, pine and Pyrenean oak to prevailing climate factors and indicated species-specific patterns of climate sensitivity. The general importance of summer conditions for tree growth was confirmed. In addition, we found directional trends in correlation with specific climate factors along spatial gradients; these results are consistent with the autoecology of the studied species. Based on these findings, we present a new model approach that can serve as a key tool for forest managers to design forest communities that are more stable during climatic change.},

Resultados:
Crecimiento-clima
- El crecimiento de los hayas est{\'{a}} influido por un clima fr{\'{i}}o y h{\'{u}}medo en el verano previo.
- El crecimiento de los pinos se ve favorecido por una mayor precipitaci{\'{o}}n y menor temperatura m{\'{a}}xima en el a{\~{n}}o en curso. Temperaturas m{\'{a}}ximas altas en primavera favorecen el crecimiento en algunas partes del parque.
- El roble es sensible a la precipitaci{\'{o}}n en todas las estaciones, si bien la influencia no se ve en todas las partes del parque.
Modelo
Se generaron 45 modelos GAM: 5 estaciones * 3 variables clim{\'{a}}ticas * 3 especies. De los 45, 22 fueron estat{\'{i}}sticamente significantes.
- Se encontraron relaciones parecidas al apartado anterior para las tres especies

Discusi{\'{o}}n:
Influencia del clima en el crecimiento:
- importancia del clima veraniego
- el haya es una especie sensible a la sequ{\'{i}}a, raz{\'{o}}n por la que su crecimiento es favorecido por veranos previos h{\'{u}}medos y menos c{\'{a}}lidos. Este hecho es especialmente notable en zonas bajas.
- el crecimiento de los pinos es favorecido por veranos h{\'{u}}medos y fr{\'{i}}os y una primavera c{\'{a}}lida, dado que alarga la {\'{e}}poca de crecimietno.
- el crecimiento del roble depende de la lluvia a lo largo de todo el a{\~{n}}o, a pesar de ser menos dependiente de la sequ{\'{i}}a que los hayas.
Aplicaci{\'{o}}n al Moncayo
- El hayedo es susceptible de expandirse hacie el sur en el rango altitudinal medio (1400-1500 msnm).
- El pino podr{\'{i}}a extenderse en zonas altas de la parte central del parque y talar controladamente en zonas aptas para especies aut{\'{o}}ctonas para favorecer su expansi{\'{o}}n.
- La susceptibilidad del roble a la sequ{\'{i}}a se puede reducir mediante poda para evitar la competencia. Crear bosques con {\'{a}}rboles de distinta edad para aumentar la resiliencia a la sequ{\'{i}}a
- Las zonas bajas del parque no son adecuadas para ninguna de estas tres especies.

Limitaciones:
- el modelo no tiene en cuenta informaci{\'{o}}n sobre requisitos clim{\'{a}}ticos de las especies m{\'{a}}s all{\'{a}} de su distribuci{\'{o}}n potencial.
- Es un modelo emp{\'{i}}rico que no puede ser extrapolado a otras localizaciones.

Futuro:
- Esta misma metodolog{\'{i}}a puede usarse para predecir cambios en las reslaciones clima-crecimiento en escenarios de cambio clim{\'{a}}tico.
- El clima futuro puede exceder el rango actual, por lo que plantear{\'{i}}a un problema con la limitaci{\'{o}}n a extrapolar antes mencionada.},

abstract = {Over the past few decades, the hydrology community has witnessed notable advancements in streamflow prediction, particularly with the introduction of cutting-edge machine-learning algorithms. Recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have become popular due to their capacity to create precise forecasts and realistically mimic the system dynamics. Attention-based models, such as Transformers, can learn from the entire data sequence concurrently, a feature that LSTM does not have. This work tests the hypothesis that combining recurrence with attention can improve streamflow prediction. We set up the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) architecture, a model that combines both of these aspects and has never been applied in hydrology before. We compare the performance of LSTM, Transformers, and TFT over 2,610 globally distributed catchments from the recently available Caravan dataset. Our results demonstrate that TFT indeed exceeds the performance benchmark set by the LSTM and Transformers for streamflow prediction. Additionally, being an explainable AI method, TFT helps in gaining insights into the streamflow generation processes.},

abstract = {Log-transformed discharge is often used to calcu- late performance criteria to better focus on low flows. This prior transformation limits the heteroscedasticity of model residuals and was largely applied in criteria based on squared residuals, like the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). In the re- cent years, NSE has been shown to have mathematical limi- tations and the Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) was proposed as an alternative to provide more balance between the ex- pected qualities of a model (namely representing the water balance, flow variability and correlation). As in the case of NSE, several authors used the KGE criterion (or its improved version KGE?) with a prior logarithmic transformation on flows. However, we show that the use of this transformation is not adapted to the case of the KGE (or KGE?) criterion and may lead to several numerical issues, potentially resulting in a biased evaluation of model performance. We present the theoretical underpinning aspects of these issues and concrete modelling examples, showing that KGE? computed on log- transformed flows should be avoided. Alternatives are discussed.},

abstract = {The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model is a widely used distributed hydrological model. However, VIC is computationally expensive in hydrologic prediction or forecast, which needs tens of thousands of runs of the model. To alleviate the burden of computation and reduce the losses of model fidelity, a new surrogate model (SM) coupling the self-organizing map and K-means clustering algorithm (SKC) with long short-term memory network (LSTM) is proposed. SKC is utilized to divide the subwatershed and select the representative cells in each subwatershed. LSTM is used to simulate the streamflow with the runoff of the representative cells. The new model is successfully applied in the Upper Brahmaputra River (UBR) basin, Southeast China. The results show that the SM-simulated streamflow has little difference from the VIC-simulated streamflow in terms of the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient efficiency, the main metric of SM performance, 0.9677 at Yangcun Station and 0.9696 at Nuxia Station. For the representative cells, SM retains partial spatial information of the runoff in the study area. The computational savings achieved through the use of SM are over 97{\%} with only slight losses of accuracy in the application to the UBR basin.},

abstract = {This paper presents the hydrological and water quality response from a series of extreme storm events that passed across the UK during the winter of 2013/2014, in an experimental catchment with a strong rural-urban gradient across four nested sub-catchment areas. The Ray catchment in the upper Thames basin, UK, was extensively monitored using in-situ, high-resolution (15 min) flow and water quality instrumentation. Dissolved oxygen, ammonium, turbidity and specific conductivity are used to characterise the water quality dynamics. The impact of the Swindon sewage treatment works (SSTW) on water chemistry at the catchment outlet is considerable. Hydrological and water-quality response varies considerably during the events, with the rural catchments exhibiting a much slower hydrological response compared to urban areas. A simple hydrological model (TETIS) was developed to provide insight into water sources in nested subcatchments, highlighting the disparity of the hydrological dynamics across contrasting land-uses during events. The variation in stormwater runoff sources impacts water quality signals with urban sites contributing to dilution dynamics in ammonium, whereas the more rural site experiences a peak in ammonium during the same event. Dissolved oxygen concentrations vary on a rural-urban gradient and experience a notable sag at the Water Eaton outlet (4.4 mg/l) during the events, that would have resulted in significant ecological harm had they occurred during the summer in warmer temperatures. The water-quality legacy of these storms in the wider context of the hydrological year is somewhat negligible, with markedly poorer water quality signals being observed during the summer months of 2014. Although ammonium concentrations during the events are elevated (above the ‘good' status threshold under the WFD), higher values are observed during spring and summer months. The high flows actually appear to flush contaminants out of the Ray and its subcatchments, though the urban sites demonstrate a resupply dynamic during interim dry periods. Data suggest winter storms following dry spells in urban catchments cause some short-lived and spatially extensive deteriorations in water quality. More chronic effects, although prolonged, are only seen downstream of SSTW. These are indicative of capacity of infrastructure being reached, and from the data do not appear to be severe enough to cause ecological harm.},

abstract = {Hydrograph separation is considered as the first step to catchment-scale water balance analysis. A wide variety of hydrograph separation methods exists ranging from empirical to analytical and physical. This study discusses a physically-based approach that combines baseflow separation and event identification with minimal data requirement. The input datasets are basin-average rainfall and discharge time series. Outputs are baseflow time series, the timing of the runoff events, differentiated as single- or multi-peak, and the associated rainfall event time series. To assess the method's feasibility, hydrograph properties are evaluated for both long-term (annual and monthly) and event-scale time series. Results show that the long-term derived baseflow indices are positive (negative) correlated with basin area (runoff coefficient). The event scale analysis shows that the timing-related parameters (i.e. durations of rainfall and flow events and time lag between rainfall to flow events) increase with basin area in terms of magnitude and variability. Similar dependence on basin scale is shown for the water balance-related parameters determined from this analysis, namely event rainfall and baseflow volumes and baseflow index. Water balance parameters are shown to be characterized with less degree of variability for single-peak events relative to multi-peak events.},

abstract = {An extraordinary convective rainfall event, unfore- seen by most numerical weather prediction models, gener- ated a devastating flash flood (305m3 s−1) in the town of Sant Lloren{\c{c}} des Cardassar, Mallorca, on 9 October 2018. Four people died inside this village, while casualties were up to 13 over the entire affected area. This extreme event has been reconstructed by implementing an integrated flash flood modelling approach in the Ses Planes catchment up to Sant Lloren{\c{c}} (23.4 km2), based on three components: (i) genera- tion of radar-derived precipitation estimates, (ii) modelling of accurate discharge hydrographs yielded by the catch- ment (using FEST and KLEM models), and (iii) hydraulic simulation of the event and mapping of affected areas (us- ing HEC-RAS). Radar-derived rainfall estimates show very high agreement with rain gauge data (R2 = 0.98). Modelled flooding extent is in close agreement with the observed ex- tension by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, based on Sentinel-1 imagery, and both far exceed the exten- sion for a 500-year return period flood. Hydraulic simulation revealed that water reached a depth of 3m at some points, and modelled water depths highly correlate (R2 = 0.91) with in situ after-event measurements. The 9 October flash flood eroded and transported woody and abundant sediment debris, changing channel geomorphology. Water velocity greatly in- creased at bridge locations crossing the river channel, es- pecially at those closer to the Sant Lloren{\c{c}} town centre. This study highlights how the very low predictability of this type of extreme convective rainfall events and the very short hydrological response times typical of small Mediter- ranean catchments continue to challenge the implementation of early warning systems, which effectively reduce people's exposure to flash flood risk in the region.},

abstract = {Uncertainty analysis is an integral part of any scientific modeling, particularly within the domain of hydrological sciences given the various types and sources of uncertainty. At the center of uncertainty rests the concept of equifinality, that is, reaching a given endpoint (finality) through different pathways. The operational definition of equifinality in hydrological modeling is that various model structures and/or parameter sets (i.e., equal pathways) are equally capable of reproducing a similar (not necessarily identical) hydrological outcome (i.e., finality). Here we argue that there is more to model equifinality than model structures/parameters, that is, other model components can give rise to model equifinality and/or could be used to explore equifinality within model space. We identified six facets of model equifinality, namely, model structure, parameters, performance metrics, initial and boundary conditions, inputs, and internal fluxes. Focusing on model internal fluxes, we developed a methodology called flux mapping that has fundamental implications in understanding and evaluating model process representation within the paradigm of multiple working hypotheses. To illustrate this, we examine the equifinality of runoff fluxes of a conceptual rainfall-runoff model for a number of different Australian catchments. We demonstrate how flux maps can give new insights into the model behavior that cannot be captured by conventional model evaluation methods. We discuss the advantages of flux space, as a subspace of the model space not usually examined, over parameter space. We further discuss the utility of flux mapping in hypothesis generation and testing, extendable to any field of scientific modeling of open complex systems under uncertainty.},

abstract = {Semi-arid forests are water limited environments considered as low-productive. As a result, these forests usually end up unmanaged and abandoned, with the subsequent wild fire risk increasing, water yield decreasing and a general diminishing of the forest resilience. Hydrological-oriented silviculture could be a useful alternative that increases management possibilities by combining forest productivity and water yield. However, the slight water yield increase after forest management together with the low forest productivity, could make this option in- sufficient for semi-arid forests, and other goods and services should be included and quantified. In this sense, the present study analyzes to what extent semi-arid forest management for water yield results effective and prof- itable at catchment scale, and how does it improve when it is combined with other benefits such as biomass production and fire risk diminishing. To that end, the effects of forest management of semi-arid Aleppo pine post-fire regeneration stands are analyzed in terms of water yield (TETIS-VEG model), fire risk (KDBY index and FARSITE) and biomass production, at catchment scale. Regarding to water yield, the results confirmed the slight effect of forest management on its increase (average increase of 0.27± 0.29mm yr−1), at the same time that highlighted the role of the upper catchment area as an important water contributor. The management produced 4161.6 Mg of biomass, and decreased in 27±17{\%} and 25.6± 14.1{\%} the fire risk and fire propagation, respec- tively. Finally, a simple economic estimation of the management profitability is carried out by means of com- paring the Benefit/Cost ratio of the managed and unmanaged scenarios. Both scenarios were always above the unity when just considering water as benefit, although the unmanaged scenario produced a higher ratio, as no management costs are expended. Contrarily, when wildfire was also included into the evaluation, the situation is overturned for wildfires equal or higher than 1.5 day duration, where the forest management is shown as the most convenient alternative. 1.},

abstract = {Bias correction of climate variables is a standard practice in climate change impact (CCI) studies. Various methodologies have been developed within the framework of quantile mapping. However, it is well known that quantile mapping may significantly modify the long-term statistics due to the time dependency of the temperature bias. Here, a method to overcome this issue without compromising the day-to-day correction statistics is presented. The methodology separates the modeled temperature signal into a normalized and a residual component relative to the modeled reference period climatology, in order to adjust the biases only for the former and preserve the signal of the later. The results show that this method allows for the preservation of the originally modeled long-term signal in the mean, the standard deviation and higher and lower percentiles of temperature. To illustrate the improvements, the methodology is tested on daily time series obtained from five Euro CORDEX regional climate models (RCMs).},

abstract = {Large-scale hydrological and water resource models (LHMs) require water storage and release schemes to represent flow regulation by reservoirs. Owing to a lack of observed reservoir operations, state-of-the-art LHMs deploy a generic reservoir scheme that may fail to represent local operating behaviors. Here we introduce a new dataset of bespoke water storage and release policies for 1,930 reservoirs of conterminous United States. The Inferred Storage Targets and Release Functions (ISTARF-CONUS) dataset relies on a new inventory of observed daily reservoir operations (ResOpsUS) to generate reservoir operating rules for 595 data-rich reservoirs. These functions are developed in a standardized form that allows for extrapolation of operating schemes to 1,335 data-scarce reservoirs—leading to the first inventory of empirically derived reservoir operating policies for all large CONUS reservoirs documented in the Global Reservoir and Dams (GRanD) database. Evaluation of the new scheme in daily simulations forced with observed inflow demonstrates substantial and robust improvement for both release and storage relative to the popular Hanasaki method. Performance of the extrapolation approach for data-scarce reservoirs is evaluated with leave-one-out validation and is shown to also offer modest gains on average over Hanasaki.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A considerable number of river basins around the world lack sufficient ground observations of hydro-meteorological data for effective water resources assessment and management. Several approaches can be developed to increase the quality and availability of data in these poorly gauged or ungauged river basins, and among those, the use of earth observations products has recently become promising. Earth observations of various environmental variables can be used potentially to increase the knowledge about the hydrological processes in the basin and to improve streamflow model estimates, via assimilation or calibration. The present study aims to calibrate the large-scale hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB using satellite-based products of evapotranspiration and soil moisture for the Moroccan Oum Er Rbia basin. Daily simulations at a spatial resolution of 5{\&}thinsp;arcmin{\&}thinsp;{\&}times;{\&}thinsp;5{\&}thinsp;arcmin are performed with varying parameters values for the 32-year period 1979{\&}ndash;2010. Five different calibration scenarios are inter-compared: (i) reference scenario using the hydrological model with the standard parameterization, (ii) calibration using in-situ observed discharge time series, (iii) calibration using GLEAM actual evapotranspiration time series, (iv) calibration using ESA CCI surface soil moisture time series and (v) step-wise calibration using GLEAM actual evapotranspiration and ESA CCI surface soil moisture time series. The impact on discharge estimates of precipitation in comparison with model parameters calibration is investigated using three global precipitation products, including EI, WFDEI and MSWEP. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Results show that GLEAM evapotranspiration and ESA CCI soil moisture may be used for model calibration resulting in reasonable discharge estimates (NSE values from 0.5 to 0.75), although better model performance is achieved when the model is calibrated with in-situ streamflow observations. Independent calibration based on only evapotranspiration or soil moisture observations improves model predictions to a lesser extent. Precipitation input affects to discharge estimates more than calibrating model parameters. The use of WFDEI precipitation leads to the lowest model performances. Apart from the in-situ discharge calibration scenario, the highest discharge improvement is obtained when EI and MSWEP precipitation products are used in combination with a step-wise calibration approach based on evapotranspiration and soil moisture observations. This study opens up the possibility to use globally available earth observations and reanalysis products of precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil moisture into large-scale hydrological models to estimate discharge at a river basin scale.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Nonetheless, tree species show different responses to drought events, which make it difficult to adopt fixed tools for monitoring drought impacts under contrasting environmental and climatic conditions. In this study, we assess the response of forest growth and a satellite proxy of the net primary production (NPP) to drought in peninsular Spain and the Balearic Islands, a region characterized by complex climatological, topographical, and environmental characteristics. Herein, we employed three different indicators based on in situ measurements and satellite image-derived vegetation information (i.e., tree-ring width, maximum annual greenness, and an indicator of NPP). We used seven different climate drought indices to assess drought impacts on the tree variables analyzed. The selected drought indices include four versions of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI, Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI), Z-index, and Palmer Modified Drought Index (PMDI)) and three multi-scalar indices (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), and Standardized Precipitation Drought Index (SPDI)). Our results suggest that—irrespective of drought index and tree species—tree-ring width shows a stronger response to interannual variability of drought, compared to the greenness and the NPP. In comparison to other drought indices (e.g., PDSI), and our results demonstrate that multi-scalar drought indices (e.g., SPI, SPEI) are more advantageous in monitoring drought impacts on tree-ring growth, maximum greenness, and NPP. This finding suggests that multi-scalar indices are more appropriate for monitoring and modelling forest drought in peninsular Spain and the Balearic Islands.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Remote sensing is a potentially powerful technology with which to extrapolate eddy covariance-based gross primary production (GPP) to continental scales. In support of this concept, we used meteorological and flux data from the AmeriFlux network and Support Vector Machine (SVM), an inductive machine learning technique, to develop and apply a predictive GPP model for the conterminous U.S. In the following four-step process, we first trained the SVM to predict flux-based GPP from 33 AmeriFlux sites between 2000 and 2003 using three remotely-sensed variables (land surface temperature, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and land cover) and one ground-measured variable (incident shortwave radiation). Second, we evaluated model performance by predicting GPP for 24 available AmeriFlux sites in 2004. In this independent evaluation, the SVM predicted GPP with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.87 gC/m2/day and an R2of 0.71. Based on annual total GPP at 15 AmeriFlux sites for which the number of 8-day averages in 2004 was no less than 67{\%} (30 out of a possible 45), annual SVM GPP prediction error was 32.1{\%} for non-forest ecosystems and 22.2{\%} for forest ecosystems, while the standard Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer GPP product (MOD17) had an error of 50.3{\%} for non-forest ecosystems and 21.5{\%} for forest ecosystems, suggesting that the regionally tuned SVM performed better than the standard global MOD17 GPP for non-forest ecosystems but had similar performance for forest ecosystems. The most important explanatory factor for GPP prediction was EVI, removal of which increased GPP RMSE by 0.85 gC/m2/day in a cross-validation experiment. Third, using the SVM driven by remote sensing data including incident shortwave radiation, we predicted 2004 conterminous U.S. GPP and found that results were consistent with expected spatial and temporal patterns. Finally, as an illustration of SVM GPP for ecological applications, we estimated maximum light use efficiency (emax), one of the most important factors for standard light use efficiency models, for the conterminous U.S. by integrating the 2004 SVM GPP with the MOD17 GPP algorithm. We found that emaxvaried from ∼ 0.86 gC/MJ in grasslands to ∼ 1.56 gC/MJ in deciduous forests, while MOD17 emaxwas 0.68 gC/MJ for grasslands and 1.16 gC/MJ for deciduous forests, suggesting that refinements of MOD17 emaxmay be beneficial. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Four daily temperature indices were calculated to describe the spatial distribution of absolute maximum and minimum temperature, number of frost days and number of summer days in Spain. The southern plateau showed the maximum values of maximum absolute temperature and summer days, while the minimum absolute temperature and frost days reached their maximums at northern plateau.

Through scenario analysis they can help to identify near-future critical locations in the face of environmental change. A dynamic, spatially explicit, land-use change model is presented for the regional scale: CLUE-S. The model is specifically developed for the analysis of land use in small regions (e.g., a watershed or province) at a fine spatial resolution. The model structure is based on systems theory to allow the integrated analysis of land-use change in relation to socio-economic and biophysical driving factors. The model explicitly addresses the hierarchical organization of land use systems, spatial connectivity between locations and stability. Stability is incorporated by a set of variables that define the relative elasticity of the actual land-use type to conversion. The user can specify these settings based on expert knowledge or survey data. Two applications of the model in the Philippines and Malaysia are used to illustrate the functioning of the model and its validation.},

Es incapaz de reproducir cambios en la tendencia de la demanda de los usos de suelo.

CLUE (Conversion of Land Use and its Effects)
Simula el cambio en el uso de suelo a partir de relaciones emp{\'{i}}ricas cuantitativas entre el uso del suelo y sus factores forzadores en combinaci{\'{o}}n con un modelo din{\'{a}}mico. Es posible simular m{\'{u}}ltiples usos del suelo a trav{\'{e}}s de la modelaci{\'{o}}n din{\'{a}}mica de la competencia entre usos. Sin embargo, debido a la agregaci{\'{o}}n espacial del modelo, su versi{\'{o}}n original no puede aplicarse a estudios regionales, raz{\'{o}}n por la que aparece la versi{\'{o}}n CLUE-S.

Caracter{\'{i}}sticas de los sistemas de uso del suelo
Conectividad: localizaciones cercanas est{\'{a}}n relacionadas
teor{\'{i}}a de jerarqu{\'{i}}as: procesos de alto rango constri{\~{n}}en procesos de menor rango, pero emergen de las din{\'{a}}micas de menor rango.
Forzamientos: factores demogr{\'{a}}ficos, econ{\'{o}}micos, tecnol{\'{o}}gicos, pol{\'{i}}ticos e institucionales, culturales, biof{\'{i}}sicos.
Resiliencia: la capacidad de absorci{\'{o}}n de perturbaciones de un ecosistema/sociedad sin sufrir cambios.
Requisitos de un modelo de cambios de uso del suelo:
* Debe analizar el cambio desde m{\'{u}}ltiples escalas interconectadas.
* Debe prestar especial atenci{\'{o}}n a los forzadores del cambio, distinguiendo los cuantitativos de los posicionales.
* La resiliencia y estabilidad del sistema hace que cambios bruscos de un forzamiento no se reproduzcan directamente en los usos del suelo.
* Debe permitir la interacci{\'{o}}n espacial entre ubicaciones y reacciones de niveles de organizaci{\'{o}}n superiores.

Estructura del modelo
M{\'{o}}dulo de demanda
de uso del suelo (no espacial) calcula el cambio en el {\'{a}}rea de cada una de las clases de suelo. Puede ser una simple extrapolaci{\'{o}}n o modelos m{\'{a}}s complejos. Genera una serie anual del {\'{a}}rea cubierta por cada clase de suelo.

M{\'{o}}dulo espacial
Asigna espacialmente la demanda de suelo del primer m{\'{o}}dulo seg{\'{u}}n una combinaci{\'{o}}n de relaciones emp{\'{i}}ricas, an{\'{a}}lisis espacial y modelado din{\'{a}}mico.
* El an{\'{a}}lisis espacial genera mapas de probabilidad de presencia de cada una de las clases del suelo. Para ello se utiliza la clasificaci{\'{o}}n binaria (ausencia-presencia) mediante stepwise logistic regression. El rendimiento del modelo se mide seg{\'{u}}n el {\'{a}}rea bajo la curva ROC.
* Las normas de decisi{\'{o}}n determinan las condiciones bajo las que cada tipo de uso del suelo puede cambiar. Hay tres tipos: usos del suelo que raramente cambian, usos f{\'{a}}cilmente convertibles y estados intermedios. Estos estados se definen por medio del coeficiente de elasticidad; valores mayores representan mayor dificultad para el cambio.
* La asginaci{\'{o}}n de usos del suelo se hace mediante un proceso iterativo.
1. Determinaci{\'{o}}n de las celdas que pueden cambiar.
2. C{\'{a}}lculo de la probabilidad total de cambio para cada celda y tipo de uso de suelo.
3. Asignaci{\'{o}}n preliminar al tipo de uso de suelo con mayor probabilidad total.
4. Se compara el {\'{a}}rea predicha con la observada para y se modifica el valor del coeficiente de 
iteraci{\'{o}}n de cada clase en funci{\'{o}}n de si sobreestim{\'{o}} o subestim{\'{o}} el {\'{a}}rea de dicho uso.
5. Iteraci{\'{o}}n de los pasos 2-4 hasta que se cumpplan los requisitos.

Discusi{\'{o}}n
El modelo predice cambios de usos del suelo reproduciendo la competencia entre usos y los patrones complejos t{\'{i}}picos de sistemas no lineales.
El modelo es sensible a la configuraci{\'{o}}n de las normas de decisi{\'{o}}n y de las elasticidades.

Investigaci{\'{o}}n futura
Futuras investagaciones deber{\'{i}}an estudiar c{\'{o}}mo definir las elasticidades en funci{\'{o}}n de observaciones pasadas.

Limitaciones
Una limitaci{\'{o}}n del modelo es que las interaciones entre las escalas y los procesos bajo estas interacciones son desconocidos.
La principal limitaci{\'{o}}n del modelo es su incapacidad para ser usado en zonas sin una historio de cambios de uso del suelo.
Es un modelo que entiende el cambio b{\'{a}}sicamente como forzado por la acci{\'{o}}n humana. No considera el cambio natural de la vegetaci{\'{o}}n; de hecho, permite delinear zonas protegidas para evitar el cambio en ellas. 
No utiliza variables clim{\'{a}}ticas para predecir los usos del suelo. Raz{\'{o}}n por la que Wagner and Fohrer (2019) a{\~{n}}ade variables hidrol{\'{o}}gicas.

Comentarios
Algunos resultados concuerdan con los obtenidos en GESDIVAH. La altitud es el principal forzador del bosque y la pendiente del pasto; el pasto es la clase con peor rendimiento.
El problema m{\'{a}}s complejo que veo es la definici{\'{o}}n de la demanda. ¿C{\'{o}}mo definir la demanda de las clases funcionales de vegetaci{\'{o}}n? Aplicando el modelo de machine learning con variables futuras permite establecer la vegetaci{\'{o}}n cl{\'{i}}max bajo las nuevas condiciones, pero es necesario ralentizar dicho cambio a un estado natural.
La ventaja de ser un modelo de cambio es que se centra {\'{u}}nicamente en cambiar ciertas celdas, con lo que se obtienen distribuciones futuras similares a la de partida.},

abstract = {The simulated outcome of a calibrated hydrologic model should be hydrologically consistent with the measured response data. Hydrologic modelers typically calibrate models to optimize residual- based goodness-of-fit measures, e.g., the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency measure, and then evaluate the obtained results with respect to hydrological signatures, e.g., the flow duration curve indices. The literature indicates that the consideration of a large number of hydrologic signatures has not been addressed in a full multiob- jective optimization context. This research develops a model calibration methodology to achieve hydrologi- cal consistency using goodness-of-fit measures, many hydrological signatures, as well as a level of acceptability for each signature. The proposed framework relies on a scoring method that transforms any hydrological signature to a calibration objective. These scores are used to develop the hydrological consis- tency metric, which is maximized to obtain hydrologically consistent parameter sets during calibration. This consistency metric is implemented in different signature-based calibration formulations that adapt the sam- pling according to hydrologic signature values. These formulations are compared with the traditional for- mulations found in the literature for seven case studies. The results reveal that Pareto dominance-based multiobjective optimization yields the highest level of consistency among all formulations. Furthermore, it is found},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that compartmentalized pools of water preferentially supply either plant transpiration (poorly mobile water) or streamflow and groundwater (highly mobile water) in some catchments, a phenomenon referred to as ecohydrologic separation. The omission of processes accounting for ecohydrologic separation in standard applications of hydrological models is expected to influence estimates of water residence times and plant water availability. However, few studies have tested this expectation or investigated how ecohydrologic separation alters interpretations of stores and fluxes of water within a catchment. In this study, we compare two rainfall-runoff models that integrate catchment-scale representations of transport, one that incorporates ecohydrologic separation and one that does not. The models were developed for a second-order watershed at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest (Oregon, USA), the site where ecohydrologic separation was first observed, and calibrated against multiple years of stream discharge and chloride concentration. Model structural variations caused mixed results for differences in calibrated parameters and differences in storage between reservoirs. However, large differences in catchment storage volumes and fluxes arise when considering only mobile water. These changes influence interpreted residence times for streamflow-generating water, demonstrating the importance of ecohydrologic separation in catchment-scale water and solute transport.},

abstract = {We assess possible modifications in the hydrological behaviour of the Rhone River and its tributaries at Lyon (France). We identify changes during the late-twentieth century based on observations and characterise potential impacts of climatic changes on river response by the end of the century. Different scenarios of the latest generation of IPCC AR5 CMIP5 and hydrological modelling were used and included two scenarios for future outlet discharge of Lake Geneva (Switzerland). We show that discharges in the Rhone basin are likely to decrease significantly by the end of the century and that the seasonality of run-off will change substantially as well. In addition, projections point to smaller discharge during low flows, but higher low flows in its sub-basins. Regarding floods, high flows exhibit a general tendency to decrease, whereas potential upwards can be observed for the more extreme floods (less frequent). The approach reported in this paper will help to reflect on the governance modalities of a transboundary river such as the Rhone, especially when water management depends on concession contracts, which are usually granted for several decades and typically last between 60 and 90 years.},

abstract = {Accurate river streamflow forecasts are a vital tool in the fields of water security, flood preparation and agriculture, as well as in industry more generally. Traditional physics-based models used to produce streamflow forecasts have become increasingly sophisticated, with forecasts improving accordingly. However, the development of such models is often bound by two soft limits: empiricism - many physical relationships are represented empirical formulae; and data sparsity - long time series of observational data are often required for the calibration of these models. Artificial neural networks have previously been shown to be highly effective at simulating non-linear systems where knowledge of the underlying physical relationships is incomplete. However, they also suffer from issues related to data sparsity. Recently, hybrid forecasting systems, which combine the traditional physics-based approach with statistical forecasting techniques, have been investigated for use in hydrological applications. In this study, we test the efficacy of a type of neural network, the long short-term memory (LSTM), at predicting streamflow at 10 river gauge stations across various climatic regions of the western United States. The LSTM is trained on the catchment-mean meteorological and hydrological variables from the ERA5 and Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS)-ERA5 reanalyses as well as historical streamflow observations. The performance of these hybrid forecasts is evaluated and compared with the performance of both raw and bias-corrected output from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) physics-based GloFAS. Two periods are considered, a testing phase (June 2019 to June 2020), during which the models were fed with ERA5 data to investigate how well they simulated streamflow at the 10 stations, and an operational phase (September 2020 to October 2021), during which the models were fed forecast variables from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), to investigate how well they could predict streamflow at lead times of up to 10 d. Implications and potential improvements to this work are discussed. In summary, this is the first time an LSTM has been used in a hybrid system to create a medium-range streamflow forecast, and in beating established physics-based models, shows promise for the future of neural networks in hydrological forecasting.},

abstract = {The increasing impacts of climate changes on water related sectors are leading the scientists' attentions to the development of comprehensive models, allowing better descriptions of the water and solute transport processes. "Getting the right answers for the right reasons", in terms of hydrological response, is one of the main goals of most of the recent literature. Semi-distributed hydrological models, based on the partition of basins in hydrological response units (HRUs) to be connected, eventually, to describe a whole catchment, proved to be robust in the reproduction of observed catchment dynamics. 'Embedded reservoirs' are often used for each HRU, to allow a consistent representation of the processes. In this work, a new semi-distributed model for runoff and evapotranspiration is presented: five different reservoirs are inter-connected in order to capture the dynamics of snow, canopy, surface flow, root-zone and groundwater compartments. The knowledge of the mass of water and solute stored and released through different outputs (e.g. discharge, evapotranspiration) allows the analysis of the hydrological travel times and solute transport in catchments. The latter have been studied extensively, with some recent benchmark contributions in the last decade. However, the literature remains obscured by different terminologies and notations, as well as model assumptions are not fully explained. The thesis presents a detailed description of a new theoretical approach that reworks the theory from the point of view of the hydrological storages and fluxes involved.Major aspects of the new theory are the 'age-ranked' definition of the hydrological variables, the explicit treatment of evaporative fluxes and of their influence on the transport, the analysis of the outflows partitioning coefficients and the explicit formulation of the 'age-ranked' equations for solutes.Moreover, the work presents concepts in a new systematic and clarified way, helping the application of the theory. To give substance to the theory, a small catchment in the prealpine area was chosen as an example and the results illustrated. The new semi-distributed model for runoff and evapotranspiration and the travel time theory were implemented and integrated in the semi-distributed hydrological system JGrass-NewAge. Thanks to the environmentalmodeling framework OMS3, each part of the hydrological cycle is implemented as a component that can be selected, adopted, and connected at run-time to obtain a user-customized hydrologicalmodel. The system is flexible, expandable and applicable in a variety of modeling solutions. In this work, the model code underwent to an extensive revision: new components were added (coupled storages water budget, travel times components); old components were enhanced (Kriging, shortwave, longwave, evapotranspiration, rain-snow separation, SWE and melting components); documentation was standardized and deployed. Since the Thesis regards in wide sense the building of a collaborative system, a discussion of some general purpose tools that were implemented or improved for supporting the present research is also presented. They include the description and the verification of a software component dealing with the long-wave radiation budget and another component dealing with an implementation of some Kriging procedure.},

abstract = {The quantification and analysis of uncertainties is important in all cases where maps and models of uncertain properties are the basis for further decisions. Once these uncertainties are identified, the logical next step is to determine how they can be reduced. Information theory provides a framework for the analysis of spatial uncertainties when different subregions are considered as random variables. In the work presented here, joint entropy, conditional entropy, and mutual information are applied for a detailed analysis of spatial uncertainty correlations. The aim is to determine (i) which areas in a spatial analysis share information, and (ii) where, and by how much, additional information would reduce uncertainties. As an illustration, a typical geological example is evaluated: the case of a subsurface layer with uncertain depth, shape and thickness. Mutual information and multivariate conditional entropies are determined based on multiple simulated model realisations. Even for this simple case, the measures not only provide a clear picture of uncertainties and their correlations but also give detailed insights into the potential reduction of uncertainties at each position, given additional information at a different location. The methods are directly applicable to other types of spatial uncertainty evaluations, especially where multiple realisations of a model simulation are analysed. In summary, the application of information theoretic measures opens up the path to a better understanding of spatial uncertainties, and their relationship to information and prior knowledge, for cases where uncertain property distributions are spatially analysed and visualised in maps and models.},

abstract = {Estimating the mean and the covariance matrix of an incomplete dataset and filling in missing values with imputed values is generally a nonlinear problem, which must be solved iteratively. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for Gaussian data, an iterative method both for the estimation of mean values and covariance matrices from incomplete datasets and for the imputation of missing values, is taken as the point of departure for the development of a regularized EM algorithm. In contrast to the conventional EM algorithm, the regularized EM algorithm is applicable to sets of climate data, in which the number of variables typically exceeds the sample size. The regularized EM algorithm is based on iterated analyses of linear regressions of variables with missing values on variables with available values, with regression coefficients estimated by ridge regression, a regularized regression method in which a continuous regularization parameter controls the filtering of the noise in the data. The regularization parameter is determined by generalized cross-validation, such as to minimize, approximately, the expected mean-squared error of the imputed values. The regularized EM algorithm can estimate, and exploit for the imputation of missing values, both synchronic and diachronic covariance matrices, which may contain information on spatial covariability, stationary temporal covariability, or cyclostationary temporal covariability. A test of the regularized EM algorithm with simulated surface temperature data demonstrates that the algorithm is applicable to typical sets of climate data and that it leads to more accurate estimates of the missing values than a conventional noniterative imputation technique.},

This tension allows them to pull water out of the soil and up to their leaves. When this liquid rope breaks, owing to cavitation, they catch the ends to keep it from unraveling and then bind it back together. In parallel, they operate a second vascular system for the circulation of metabolites though their tissues, this time with positive pressures and flow that passes from leaf to root. In this article, we review the current state of understanding of water management in plants with an emphasis on the rich coupling of transport phenomena, thermodynamics, and active biological processes. We discuss efforts to replicate plant function in synthetic systems and point to opportunities for physical scientists and engineers to benefit from and contribute to the study of plants.},

abstract = {The skill of a forecast can be assessed by comparing the relative proximity of both the forecast and a benchmark to the observations. Example benchmarks include climatology or a na{\"{i}}ve forecast. Hydrological ensemble prediction systems (HEPS) are currently transforming the hydrological forecasting environment but in this new field there is little information to guide researchers and operational forecasters on how benchmarks can be best used to evaluate their probabilistic forecasts. In this study, it is identified that the forecast skill calculated can vary depending on the benchmark selected and that the selection of a benchmark for determining forecasting system skill is sensitive to a number of hydrological and system factors. A benchmark intercomparison experiment is then undertaken using the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), a reference forecasting system and a suite of 23 different methods to derive benchmarks. The benchmarks are assessed within the operational set-up of the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) to determine those that are 'toughest to beat' and so give the most robust discrimination of forecast skill, particularly for the spatial average fields that EFAS relies upon.Evaluating against an observed discharge proxy the benchmark that has most utility for EFAS and avoids the most na{\"{i}}ve skill across different hydrological situations is found to be meteorological persistency. This benchmark uses the latest meteorological observations of precipitation and temperature to drive the hydrological model. Hydrological long term average benchmarks, which are currently used in EFAS, are very easily beaten by the forecasting system and the use of these produces much na{\"{i}}ve skill. When decomposed into seasons, the advanced meteorological benchmarks, which make use of meteorological observations from the past 20. years at the same calendar date, have the most skill discrimination. They are also good at discriminating skill in low flows and for all catchment sizes. Simpler meteorological benchmarks are particularly useful for high flows. Recommendations for EFAS are to move to routine use of meteorological persistency, an advanced meteorological benchmark and a simple meteorological benchmark in order to provide a robust evaluation of forecast skill. This work provides the first comprehensive evidence on how benchmarks can be used in evaluation of skill in probabilistic hydrological forecasts and which benchmarks are most useful for skill discrimination and avoidance of na{\"{i}}ve skill in a large scale HEPS. It is recommended that all HEPS use the evidence and methodology provided here to evaluate which benchmarks to employ; so forecasters can have trust in their skill evaluation and will have confidence that their forecasts are indeed better.},
annote = {Summary:

The idea behind this paper is that the model benchmark used to assess the skill of a forecast must be chosen with consideration. Na{\"{i}}ve benchmarks do not discriminate correctly the forecast skill, whereas the authors state the idea that the tougher to bit is the benchmark, the better it will discriminate the skill forecast.

Objectives:

To demonstrate how the calculated forecast skill vary depending on the benchmark.
To demonstrate that the discrimination skill of a benchmark depends on some hydrological features.
To show how a benchmark intercomparison can be made for a large scale forecasting system.

Methods:

23 benchmarks (climatological and change-signal):
5 simple meteorological benchmarks.
5 simple meteorological benchmarks with zero precitpitation.
2 advanced meteorological benchmarks.
2 advanced meteorological benchmarks with zero precipitation.
5 simple hydrological benchmarks.
4 climatic hydrological benchmarks.
The skill score used is the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) or the threshold-weighted continuous rank probability score (CRPSt).
Benchmarks are compared against an observed discharge proxy under several conditions:
Full hydrograph, including a sesonal analysis
Decomposed hydrograph: rising and falling limbs
High and low flows
Catchment response time and size
For some points where there are stations, benchmarks are compared against gauged discharge.

Results:

In general, the results show that the advanced meteorological benchmarks have lower CRPS, which means that they are tougher to beat and better discriminators.
In an operational system such us EFAS a compromise between the power of a benchmark and its computational costs. Meteorological benchmarks are more expensive than hydrological ones since they require running the hydrological model.
The paper recommends for EFAS to implement an advanced meteorological benchmark: observations of temperature and precipitation from the past 20 years at the same calendar day.},

abstract = {Plant ecologists have proposed a variety of optimization theories to explain the adaptive behaviour and evolution of plants from the perspective of natural selection ('survival of the fittest'). Optimization theories identify some objective function such as shoot or canopy photosynthesis, or growth rate which is maximized with respect to one or more plant functional traits. However, the link between these objective functions and individual plant fitness is seldom quantified and there remains some uncertainty about the most appropriate choice of objective function to use. Here, plants are viewed from an alternative thermodynamic perspective, as members of a wider class of non-equilibrium systems for which maximum entropy production (MEP) has been proposed as a common theoretical principle. I show how MEP unifies different plant optimization theories that have been proposed previously on the basis of ad hoc measures of individual fitness the different objective functions of these theories emerge as examples of entropy production on different spatiotemporal scales. The proposed statistical explanation of MEP, that states of MEP are by far the most probable ones, suggests a new and extended paradigm for biological evolution-survival of the likeliest' which applies from biomacromolecules to ecosystems, not just to individuals.},

annote = {Objetivo
Se muestran los resultados de un estudio en una c{\'{a}}mara de crecimiento realizado para determinar el impacto de la textura del suelo sobre la importancia relativa de las resistencias hidr{\'{a}}ulicas (suelo, interfacial o radical).

Theory
Se utiliza el modelo de Campbell (1976). Se define una zona de la ra{\'{i}}z denominada "rizhosheath" en la que opera la resitencia interfacial. 
Se define el flujo por longitud unitaria de ra{\'{i}}z.

M{\'{e}}todos
Se planta girasol en una serie de ra{\'{i}}ces con tres texturas de suelo. Para cada textura se traza las curvas de retenci{\'{o}}n del suelo y se calcula la conductividad hidr{\'{a}}ulica.
De las plantas ya desarrolladas se obtienen cuatro par{\'{a}}metros: la transpiraci{\'{o}}n y el potencial del xilema a partir de las hojas, longitud de la ra{\'{i}}z y humedad del suelo.

Resultados
La resistentica interfacial+radical aumenta conforme el suelo se seca. El aumento m{\'{a}}s intenso ocurre en la arena.
Se dibujan las gr{\'{a}}ficas de resitencia vs potencial m{\'{a}}trico y de resistencia vs humedad del suelo. De ellas se extrae que la resistencia de las ra{\'{i}}ces es un valor espec{\'{i}}fico de cada especie de planta, e independiente de la textura del suelo y del potencial m{\'{a}}trico.
No se encontr{\'{o}} evidencia del transporte de agua en fase gaseosa entre el suelo y la ra{\'{i}}z en condiciones secas que postulan algunos autores.
La resistencia interfacial+radical puede expresarse:
Rir = Rir,min{\{}1 + alpha{\textperiodcentered}exp[-beta(theta/thetas - delta)]{\}}

Limitaciones
La densidad de las ra{\'{i}}ces en las muestras es mucho mayor de la que se obtendr{\'{i}}a en condiciones de campo.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors. Snow constitutes a key component of the water cycle, which is directly affected by changes in climate. Mountainous regions, especially those located in semiarid environments, are highly vulnerable to shifts from snowfall to rainfall. This study evaluates the influence of future climate scenarios on the snowfall regime in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, an Alpine/Mediterranean climate region in southern Spain. Precipitation and temperature projections from two future climate scenarios representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5, Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (AR5 IPCC)) were use d to estimate the projected evolution of the snowfall regime on both annual and decadal scales during the period of 2006-2100. Specific snowfall descriptors of torrentiality are also analyzed. A general decrease of the annual snowfall was estimated, with a significant trend that ranged from 0.21 to 0.55 (mm ˙ year -1 )˙year -1 . These changes are dependent on the scenario and region in the study area. However, the major impact of future climate scenarios on the snowfall regime relates to an increased torrentiality of snowfall occurrence, with a decreased trend of the annual number of snowfall days (RCP 4.5: -0.068 (days˙year -1 )˙year -1 and RCP 8.5: -0.111 (days˙year -1 )˙year -1 ) and an increased trend in the annual mean snowfall intensity (RCP 4.5: 0.006 (mm˙days -1 )˙year -1 and RCP8.5: 0.01 (mm˙days -1 )˙year -1 )) under both scenarios. This enhanced torrentiality is heterogeneously distributed, with the most semiarid region, which is currently the one least influenced by snow, being the region most affected within the study area.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract. Reservoirs are ubiquitous water infrastructure, providing functional capability to manage, and often mitigate, hydrological variability across space and time. The presence and operation of a reservoir control the downstream flow regime, such that in many locations understanding reservoir operations is crucial to understanding the hydrological functioning of a catchment. Despite many advances in modelling reservoir operations, inclusion of reservoirs in large-scale hydrological modelling remains challenging, particularly when the number of reservoirs is large and data access is limited. Here we design a set of simple reservoir operating rules (with only two calibrated parameters) focused on simulating small water supply reservoirs across large scales with various types of open-access data (i.e. catchment attributes and flows at downstream gauges). We integrate our rules into a national-scale hydrological model of Great Britain and compare hydrological simulations with and without the new reservoir component. Our simple reservoir operating rules significantly increase model performance in reservoir-impacted catchments, particularly when the rules are calibrated individually at each downstream gauge. We also test the feasibility of using transfer functions (which transform reservoir and catchment attributes into operating rule parameters) to identify a nationally consistent calibration. This works well in ∼ 50 {\%} of the catchments, while nuances in individual reservoir operations limit performance in others. We suggest that our approach should provide a lower benchmark for simulations in catchments containing water supply reservoirs and that more complex methods should only be considered where they outperform our simple approach.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Especially important to predictive vegetation mapping are interpolated climatic variables related to physiological tolerances, and topographic variables, derived from digital elevation grids, related to site energy and moisture balance. Predictive vegetation mapping is founded in ecological niche theory and gradient analysis, and driven by the need to map vegetation pattems over large areas for resource conservation planning, and to predict the effects of environmental change on vegetation distributions.

The destructive capabilities of flooding have the potential to destabilize entire nations due to the large-scale economic damage inflicted as well as the death and displacement of a large population. Modern flood warning systems (FWSs) have been developed and evolved to serve various needs of different communities, regions, or nations, especially those that are prone to flooding. Because the needs for FWSs differ significantly in terms of scopes, sizes, and complexities, they also differ significantly in terms of capabilities and advantages. To help readers have a broader and deeper understanding of different FWSs, this chapter provides a general overview of FWSs, including gauge networks, radar and satellite precipitation measurements, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, and data-driven (DD) methods with detailed introductions for each type of FWSs (monitoring, radar-based, and DD). The authors believe that a continued investment in FWSs as sustainable urban development practices and a global adoption of such practices will minimize flood damages to the greatest extent.},

abstract = {Flood early warning systems mitigate damages and loss of life and are an economically efficient way of enhancing disaster resilience. The use of continental scale flood early warning systems is rapidly growing. The European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) is a pan-European flood early warning system forced by a multi-model ensemble of numerical weather predictions. Responses to scientific and technical changes can be complex in these computationally expensive continental scale systems, and improvements need to be tested by evaluating runs of the whole system. It is demonstrated here that forecast skill is not correlated with the value of warnings. In order to tell if the system has been improved an evaluation strategy is required that considers both forecast skill and warning value. The combination of a multi-forcing ensemble of EFAS flood forecasts is evaluated with a new skill-value strategy. The full multi-forcing ensemble is recommended for operational forecasting, but, there are spatial variations in the optimal forecast combination. Results indicate that optimizing forecasts based on value rather than skill alters the optimal forcing combination and the forecast performance. Also indicated is that model diversity and ensemble size are both important in achieving best overall performance. The use of several evaluation measures that consider both skill and value is strongly recommended when considering improvements to early warning systems.},
annote = {Objective

* To prove whether there is a  correlation between forecast skill and value.
* To analyze the skill and value of several combinations of forecasts (both probabilistic and deterministic) in the EFAS framework. The hypothesis is that full multi-model forcing will provide the highest skill and highest warning value.

Data

Observed

Discharge proxy obtained by simulation of observed meteorology with the same hydrological model setup.

Forecast

2 years (January 2012, December 2013) of EFAS reforecast data. It includes 4 NWP models: deterministic DWD, deterministic ECMWF, probabilistic ECMWF-ENS, probabilistic COSMO-LEPS. Forecasts are issued daily with 10 d lead time, but the study focuses only from day 3 onwards.

Methods

Forecast combination and optimization

To combine forecasts, weights are given to each individual forecast for each of the 768 river catchments. They use nonhomogeneous Gaussian regression (NGR); this is a methodology that corrects the raw forecast including the uncertainty derived from a linear regression between past forecasts and observations, and the spread in the current forecast.

Where a and bi are bias correction parameters (related to the forecast mean Mi), c and di are spread correction parameters (related to the forecast standard deviation Si). The parameters are estimated with the las 90 d of forecasts. 5 optimization methods are applied:

* Continuous rank probability      score (CRPS)
* CRPS lagged with forecasts      from 3-10 days before.
* Symmetric extreme dependency      index (SEDI). It is built out of the hit rate and false alarm rate from      the contingency table.
* Hit rate
* Value, which the authors      measure simply as the number of hits. I don't understand why.

Sensitivity analysis

They apply two approaches:

* Leave one out comparison      (LOOC): comparison between combinations that apply a forcing with those      that do not apply it.
* Add one in comparison (AOIC):      an individual forcing is added to each combinations and compared to the      combination without it.

Skill scores are derived from the previous metrics used in the optimization. It means that they are normalized by dividing it by a reference score.

Results

Is an optimization method looking at both skill and value required?

* Spearman rank correlation      coefficients prove a week correlation between skill and value.
* The full multi-model approach      ranks higher both for CRPS and value.

Which NWP forcings have the greatest relative contribution to improved forecast performance?

* DWD, ECMWF-HRES and ECMWF-ENS      have a positive contribution.
* COSMO-LEPS does not add value      in general, but it is interesting in certain areas like the Alps.
* There are strong spatial      dependencies that suggest that using forcings specifically for each      catchment will improve performance.

Which NWP forcing most improves forecast performance when added to an existing configuration?

* The value of multi-forcing      ensembles is proved, with increasing skill and value for larger      configurations.
*Model diversity is important      (ECMWF deterministic and probabilistic are too similar) in order to      improve the hit rate, but ensemble size is more important for improving      CRPS},

Outside of hydrology, Transformers have now become the model of choice for sequential prediction tasks, making it a curious architecture to investigate. Here, we first show that a vanilla Transformer architecture is not competitive against LSTM on the widely benchmarked CAMELS dataset, and lagged especially for the high-flow metrics due to short-term processes. However, a recurrence-free variant of Transformer can obtain mixed comparisons with LSTM, producing the same Kling-Gupta efficiency coefficient (KGE), along with other metrics. The lack of advantages for the Transformer is linked to the Markovian nature of the hydrologic prediction problem. Similar to LSTM, the Transformer can also merge multiple forcing dataset to improve model performance. While the Transformer results are not higher than current state-of-the-art, we still learned some valuable lessons: (1) the vanilla Transformer architecture is not suitable for hydrologic modeling; (2) the proposed recurrence-free modification can improve Transformer performance so future work can continue to test more of such modifications; and (3) the prediction limits on the dataset should be close to the current state-of-the-art model. As a non-recurrent model, the Transformer may bear scale advantages for learning from bigger datasets and storing knowledge. This work serves as a reference point for future modifications of the model.},

It was argued that even complex modeling does not provide better results. Climate change and soil heterogeneity has got an important role in finding out surface runoff. In this paper, we are going to discuss briefly about variable infiltration capacity model (VIC), TOPMODEL, HBV, MIKESHE and soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model. VIC performs well in moist areas and can be efficiently used in the water management for agricultural purposes. Requirement of large data and physical parameters makes the use of MIKE SHE model limited to smaller catchments.

abstract = {The seasonal evolution of snow cover has significant impacts on the hydrological cycle and microclimate in mountainous regions. However, snow processes also play a crucial role in triggering alpine mass movements and flooding, posing risks to people and infrastructure. To mitigate these risks, many countries use operational forecast systems for snow distribution and melt. This paper presents the Swiss Operational Snow-hydrological (OSHD) model system, developed to provide daily analysis and forecasts on snow cover dynamics throughout Switzerland. The OSHD system is a sophisticated snow hydrological model designed specifically for the high-alpine terrain of the Swiss Alps. It leverages exceptional station data and high-resolution meteorological forcing data, as well as various reanalysis products to combine snow modeling with advanced data assimilation and meteorological downscaling methods. The system offers models of varying complexity, each tailored to specific modeling strategies and applications. For snowmelt runoff forecasting, monitoring snow water resources, and research-grade purposes, the OSHD system employs physics-based modeling chains. For snow climatological assessments, a conceptual model chain is available. We are pleased to present two comprehensive datasets from the conceptual and physics-based models that cover the entirety of Switzerland. The first dataset comprises a snow water equivalent climatology spanning 1998-2022, with a spatial resolution of 1 km. The second dataset includes snow distribution and snow melt data spanning 2016-2022 at a high spatial resolution of 250 m. To meet the needs of a multipurpose snow hydrological model framework, the OSHD system employs various strategies for process representation and sub-grid parameterizations at the snow-canopy-atmosphere interface, particularly in complex terrain. Recent and ongoing model developments are aimed at accounting for complex forest snow processes, representing slope and ridge-scale precipitation and snow redistribution processes, as well as improving probabilistic snow forecasts and data assimilation procedures based on remote sensing products.},

abstract = {Hydrological models are usually calibrated against observed streamflow (Qobs), which is not applicable for ungauged river basins. Afew studies have exploited remotely sensed evapotranspiration (ETRS) for model calibration but their effectiveness on streamflow simulation remains uncertain. This paper investigates the use of ETRS in the hydrological calibration of a widely used land surface model coupled with a source-sink routing scheme and global optimization algorithm for 28 natural river basins. A baseline simulation is a setup based on the latest model developments and inputs. Sensitive parameters are determined for Qobs and ETRS-based model calibrations, respectively, through comprehensive sensitivity tests. The ETRS-based model calibration results in a mean Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) value of 0.54 for streamflow simulation; 61{\%} of the river basins have KGE {\textgreater} 0.5 in the validation period, which is consistent with the calibration period and provides a significant improvement over the baseline. Compared to Qobs, the ETRS calibration produces better or similar streamflow simulations in 29{\%} of the basins, while further significant improvements are achieved when either better ET or precipitation observations are used. Furthermore, the model results show better or similar performance in 68{\%} of the basins and outperform the baseline simulations in 90{\%} of the river basins using model parameters from the best ETRS calibration runs. This study confirms that with reasonable precipitation input, the ETRS-based spatially distributed calibration can efficiently tune parameters for better ET and streamflow simulations. The application of ETRS for global scale hydrological model calibration promises even better streamflow accuracy as the satellite-based ETRS observations continue to improve.},

abstract = {The metabolism of a river basin is defined as the set of processes through which the basin maintains its structure and responds to its environment. Green (or biotic) metabolism is measured via transpiration and blue (or abiotic) metabolism through runoff. A principle of equal metabolic rate per unit area throughout the basin structure is developed and tested in a river basin characterized by large heterogeneities in precipitation, vegetation, soil, and geomorphology. This principle is suggested to have profound implications for the spatial organization of river basin hydrologic dynamics, including the minimization of energy expenditure known to control the scale-invariant characteristics of river networks over several orders of magnitude. Empirically derived, remarkably constant rates of average transpiration per unit area through the basin structure lead to a power law for the probability distribution of transpiration from a randomly chosen subbasin. The average runoff per unit area, evaluated for subbasins of a wide range of topological magnitudes, is also shown to be remarkably constant independently of size. A similar result is found for the rainfall after accounting for canopy interception. Allometric scaling of metabolic rates with size, variously addressed in the biological literature and network theory under the label of Kleiber's law, is similarly derived. The empirical evidence suggests that river basin metabolic activity is linked with the spatial organization that takes place around the drainage network and therefore with the mechanisms responsible for the fractal geometry of the network, suggesting a new coevolutionary framework for biological, geomorphological, and hydrologic dynamics.},

abstract = {Practical experience with the calibration of hydrologic models suggests that any single-objective function, no matter how carefully chosen, is often inadequate to properly measure all of the characteristics of the observed data deemed to be important. One strategy to circumvent this problem is to define several optimization criteria (objective functions) that measure different (complementary) aspects of the system behavior and to use multicriteria optimization to identify the set of nondominated, efficient, or Pareto optimal solutions. In this paper, we present an efficient and effective Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler, entitled the Multiobjective Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis (MOSCEM) algorithm, which is capable of solving the multiobjective optimization problem for hydrologic models. MOSCEM is an improvement over the Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis (SCEM-UA) global optimization algorithm, using the concept of Pareto dominance (rather than direct single-objective function evaluation) to evolve the initial population of points toward a set of solutions stemming from a stable distribution (Pareto set). The efficacy of the MOSCEM-UA algorithm is compared with the original MOCOM-UA algorithm for three hydrologic modeling case studies of increasing complexity.},

The construction activities may result an increase of river water pollution, especially sediment concentration, in some Singapore rivers near construction sites. As part of control strategy, silts and sediments can be discharged in stormwater drainage system with the maximum allowable limit of 50 mg/L of total suspended solids. Continuous direct measurement of total suspended solids can be conducted during river water sampling in various river streams. However the method is very time consuming due to a large number of water samples needed for the analysis. A random study was conducted from January 2010 to July 2011 in several river streams in Singapore. In this study each of total suspended solids measurement was paired with relatively fast turbidity measurement at a preliminary defined location of 50- 100 m away from any construction sites. The correlation between TSS and turbidity was established to offer more efficiency in predicting total suspended solids concentration in a river. A positive relationship between total suspended solids concentration and turbidity level suggested that the measurement of turbidity is possibly the most economic option for estimating total suspended solids concentration in a river.},

abstract = {Baseflow is critical for water balance budget, water resources management, and environmental evaluation. Prediction of baseflow index (BFI), the ratio of baseflow to total streamflow, has a great significance in unravelling the baseflow characteristics for large scale trajectory. Therefore, this study compares BFI predictive performance derived from a new multilevel regression approach along with two other commonly used approaches: hydrological modelling (SIMHYD, a simplified version of the HYDROLOG model, and Xinanjiang model), and linear regression (traditional linear regression, and alternative traditional regression considers the second-order interaction). The multilevel regression approach does not only group the catchments into the four climate zones (arid, tropics, equiseasonal and winter rainfall), but also considers inter-catchment and inter-climate zone variances. Likewise, calibration and two regionalisation techniques namely spatial proximity and integrated similarity are used to obtain the BFI from hydrological modelling approach. Correspondingly, the traditional linear regression technique estimates BFI establishing linear regressions between catchment attributes and four climate zones. Then, all the three approaches are evaluated against combined average estimation from four well-parameterised baseflow separation methods (Lyne-Hollick (LH), United Kingdom Institute of Hydrology (UKIH), Chapman-Maxwell (CM) and Eckhardt (ECK)) at 596 catchments across Australia for 1980–2012. The findings show that the multilevel regression has greatly improved the performance of BFI prediction in comparison to other methods. In particular, the two calibrated and regionalised hydrological models perform worst in predicting BFI with a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of −8.44 and −2.58 along with an absolute percent bias (PBIAS) of 81{\%} and 146{\%} (overestimation of baseflow), respectively. However, the traditional linear regression remains in intermediate position with the NSE of 0.57 and bias of 25. In addition, alternative traditional regression also shows very close proximity. In contrast, the multilevel regression approach shows the best performance with the NSE of 0.75 and bias of 19{\%}. The study also demonstrates that the multilevel regression approach can improve BFI prediction, and shows potential for being used in the prediction of other hydrological signatures in large-scale.},

@article{Rajib2018,
abstract = {A hydrologic model, calibrated using only streamflow data, can produce acceptable streamflow simulation at the watershed outlet yet unrealistic representations of water balance across the landscape. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of multi-objective calibration using remotely sensed evapotranspiration (ET) and gaged streamflow data to spatially improve the water balance. However, methodological clarity on how to “best” integrate ET data and model parameters in multi-objective model calibration to improve simulations is lacking. To address these limitations, we assessed how a spatially explicit, distributed calibration approach that uses (1) remotely sensed ET data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and (2) frequently overlooked biophysical parameters can improve the overall predictability of two key components of the water balance: streamflow and ET at different locations throughout the watershed. We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), previously modified to represent hydrologic transport and filling-spilling of landscape depressions, in a large watershed of the Prairie Pothole Region, United States. We employed a novel stepwise series of calibration experiments to isolate the effects (on streamflow and simulated ET) of integrating biophysical parameters and spatially explicit remotely sensed ET data into model calibration. Results suggest that the inclusion of biophysical parameters involving vegetation dynamics and energy utilization mechanisms tend to increase model accuracy. Furthermore, we found that using a lumped, versus a spatially explicit, approach for integrating ET into model calibration produces a sub-optimal model state with no potential improvement in model performance across large spatial scales. However, when we utilized the same MODIS ET datasets but calibrated each sub-basin in the spatially explicit approach, water yield prediction uncertainty decreased, including a distinct improvement in the temporal and spatial accuracy of simulated ET and streamflow. This further resulted in a more realistic simulation of vegetation growth when compared to MODIS Leaf-Area Index data. These findings afford critical insights into the efficient integration of remotely sensed “big data” into hydrologic modeling and associated watershed management decisions. Our approach can be generalized and potentially replicated using other hydrologic models and remotely sensed data resources – and in different geophysical settings of the globe.},

abstract = {Keith Beven has challenged our views on hydrological modeling for over 30 years (Beven, 1987, 1989, 1993, 2016; Beven et al., 2014), and especially our expectations on the predicative capabilities of hydrological models under changed conditions. Changed conditions are common because hydrological systems are frequently affected by changes such as deforestation, afforestation, changes in tree spe- cies composition, terracing, tillage, drainage, urbanization, road build- ing and changes in climate. A key challenge for hydrologists is to quantify how runoff and other hydrological variables change as a con- sequence of these changes in land‐use, land‐cover or climate. Over the past few decades, the importance of these hydrological changes and nonstationarity have been increasingly recognized (Milly et al., 2008; Montanari et al., 2013; Ceola et al., 2014). Besides empirical approaches, such as paired catchment studies and manipulation experiments, hydrological models are often used for change impact studies. Hydrological change modelling has received increased atten- tion in recent years, as can be seen by the focus of the current IAHS (International Association of Hydrological Sciences) scientific decade ‘Panta Rhei—Everything Flows' (Montanari et al., 2013) and a special issue in the Hydrological Sciences Journal (Thirel et al., 2015), but remains difficult. With regard to forestry impacts, for instance, Jones et al. (2009) commented that ‘[t]he principles of forest hydrologic responses to management are well established, but prediction is still a challenge'.},
annote = {Resumen:
Se comentan los requisitos de un modelo hidrol{\'{o}}gico para cuantificar los efectos del cambio en la hidrolog{\'{i}}a de una cuenca y se proponen recomendaciones para el uso de modelos para la detecci{\'{o}}n y predicci{\'{o}}n del cambio. Se comenta c{\'{o}}mo el an{\'{a}}lisis de la incertidumbre/equifinalidad pueden ser usados para dar una cuantificaci{\'{o}}n m{\'{a}}s realista del impacto del cambio.

Detecci{\'{o}}n del cambio:
Los modelos de detecci{\'{o}}n del cambio simulan el caudal en un cuenca si no hubiera existido cambio. La comparaci{\'{o}}n con las observaciones hechas despu{\'{e}}s del cambio permite estimar el impacto del cambio.
- El modelo hidrol{\'{o}}gico debe ser capaz de reproducir el caudal antes del cambio (simple split sample test y calibraci{\'{o}}n autom{\'{a}}tica). 
- Modelos simples de tanques son m{\'{a}}s {\'{u}}tiles que modelos f{\'{i}}sicos.
- Dado que la diferencia en la parametrizaci{\'{o}}n pre-post cambio puede ser debida a la inceridugmbre en vez de al cambio, es mejor utilizar la distribuci{\'{o}}n de las parametrizaciones {\'{o}}ptimas.

Predicci{\'{o}}n del impacto:
Caso m{\'{a}}s simple: cambio en las variables clim{\'{a}}ticas. Sin embargo, pueden haber refuerzos positivos o negativos que dificulten la simulaci{\'{o}}n.
- Es necesario que el modelo calibrado simule correctamente periodos de condiciones diversas (h{\'{u}}medo, seco...). Utilizar differential spit-sample test

Caso m{\'{a}}s complicado: cambio en las caracter{\'{i}}sticas de la cuenca y su funcionamiento.  Se asume que se pueden estimar los valores de los par{\'{a}}metros para el periodo despu{\'{e}}s del cambio y que dichos valores capturan el impacto del cambio.
-Uso de test ciegos.
- Los autores afirman que la predicci{\'{o}}n del cambio cuando {\'{e}}ste es debido a una variaci{\'{o}}n del funcionamiento de la cuenca no es posible en casos reales. S{\'{o}}lo se puede estimar el impacto en el cambio de ciertas partes del ciclo, lo cual deber ser claramente explicado al presentar los resultados.

Retos:
Los cambios suelen ser graduales y no instant{\'{a}}neos.

Recomendaciones:
- Tanto para la deteccion como la predicci{\'{o}}n del cambio, la equifinalidad deber{\'{i}}a siempre ser considerada y la incertidumbre del modelo cuantificada.
- Los resultados deben expresar claramente las variables incluidas y omitidas en la estimaci{\'{o}}n del cambio.
- Se aconseja el uso de test ciegos.
- Estudios de campo centrados en respuestas internas del ciclo hidrol{\'{o}}gico (m{\'{a}}s all{\'{a}} del caudal) y en analizar las tasas de cambio.},

Three potential evapotran- spiration (PET) equations (Hargreaves, Priestley–Taylor and Penman–Monteith) were used for the SWAT simulation of AET. The reference simulations were the three AET vari- ables simulated with SWAT before model calibration took place. The sequential uncertainty fitting technique (SUFI-2) was used for the SWAT model sensitivity analysis, calibra- tion, validation and uncertainty analysis. The GLEAM{\_}v3.0a and MOD16 products were subsequently used to calibrate the three SWAT-simulated AET variables, thereby obtaining six calibrations–validations at a monthly timescale. The model performance for the three SWAT model runs was evaluated for each of the 53 subbasins against the GLEAM{\_}v3.0a and MOD16 products, which enabled the best model run with the highest-performing satellite-based AET product to be cho- sen. A verification of the simulated AET variable was carried out by (i) comparing the simulated AET of the calibrated model to GLEAM{\_}v3.0b AET, which is a product that has different forcing data than the version of GLEAM used for the calibration, and (ii) assessing the long-term average an- nual and average monthly water balances at the outlet of the watershed. Overall, the SWAT model, composed of the Harg- reaves PET equation and calibrated using the GLEAM{\_}v3.0a data (GS1), performed well for the simulation of AET and provided a good level of confidence for using the SWAT model as a decision support tool. The 95{\%} uncertainty of the SWAT-simulated variable bracketed most of the satellite- based AET data in each subbasin. A validation of the simu- lated soil moisture dynamics for GS1 was carried out using satellite-retrieved soil moisture data, which revealed good agreement. The SWAT model (GS1) also captured the sea- sonal variability of the water balance components at the out- let of the watershed. This study demonstrated the potential to use remotely sensed evapotranspiration data for hydrological model cali- bration and validation in a sparsely gauged large river basin with reasonable accuracy. The novelty of the study is the use of these freely available satellite-derived AET datasets to ef- fectively calibrate and validate an eco-hydrological model for a data-scarce catchment.},

abstract = {The use of flexible hydrological model structures for hypothesis testing requires an objective and diagnostic method to identify whether a rainfall-runoff model structure is suitable for a certain catchment. To determine if a model structure is realistic, i.e. if it captures the relevant runoff processes, both performance and consistency are important. We define performance as the ability of a model structure to mimic a specific part of the hydrological behaviour in a specific catchment. This can be assessed based on evaluation criteria, such as the goodness of fit of specific hydrological signatures obtained from hydrological data. Consistency is defined as the ability of a model structure to adequately reproduce several hydrological signatures simultaneously while using the same set of parameter values. In this paper we describe and demonstrate a new evaluation Framework for Assessing the Realism of Model structures (FARM). The evaluation framework tests for both performance and consistency using a principal component analysis on a range of evaluation criteria, all emphasizing different hydrological behaviour. The utility of this evaluation framework is demonstrated in a case study of two small headwater catchments (Maimai, New Zealand, and Wollefsbach, Luxembourg). Eight different hydrological signatures and eleven model structures have been used for this study. The results suggest that some model structures may reveal the same degree of performance for selected evaluation criteria while showing differences in consistency. The results also show that some model structures have a higher performance and consistency than others. The principal component analysis in combination with several hydrological signatures is shown to be useful to visualise the performance and consistency of a model structure for the study catchments. With this framework performance and consistency are evaluated to identify which model structure suits a catchment better compared to other model structures. Until now the framework has only been based on a qualitative analysis and not yet on a quantitative analysis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s).},

abstract = {Measuring the spatiotemporal dynamics of lake and reservoir water storage is fundamental for assessing the influence of climate variability and anthropogenic activities on water quantity and quality. Previous studies estimated relative water volume changes for lakes where both satellite-derived extent and radar altimetry data are available. This approach is limited to only a few hundred lakes worldwide and cannot estimate absolute (i.e. total volume) water storage. We increased the number of measured lakes by a factor of 300 by using high-resolution Landsat and Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing and ICESat-2 laser altimetry, in addition to radar altimetry from the Topex/Poseidon; Jason-1, Jason-2 and Jason-3; and Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-6 instruments. Historical time series (1984-2020) of water storage could be derived for more than 170000 lakes globally with a surface area of at least 1km2, representing 99{\%} of the total volume of all water stored in lakes and reservoirs globally. Specifically, absolute lake volumes are estimated based on topographic characteristics and lake properties that can be observed by remote sensing. In addition to that, we also generated relative lake volume changes solely based on satellite-derived heights and extents if both were available. Within this dataset, we investigated how many lakes can be measured in near real time (2020-current) in basins worldwide. We developed an automated workflow for near-real-time global lake monitoring of more than 27000 lakes. The GloLakes historical and near-real-time lake storage dynamics data from 1984 to current are publicly available through 10.25914/K8ZF-6G46 (Hou et al., 2022c) and a web-based data explorer (http://www.globalwater.online, last access: 12 December 2023).},

abstract = {Barrier islands shrub thickets, the dominant woody community of many Atlantic coast barrier islands, are very sensitive to changes in the freshwater lens and thus, constitute a strong indicator of summer drought. NDVI was computed from airborne images and multispectral images on Hog Island (VA, USA) to evaluate summer growing season changes in woody communities for better predictions of climate change effects. Patterns of NDVI were compared year to year and monthly relative to precipitation and water table depth at the appropriate temporal scale. The highest absolute values of NDVI as well as the larger surface covered by woody vegetation (NDVI {\textgreater} 0.5) occurred in the wet year (2004) with a bimodal distribution of NDVI values (around 0.65 and 0.9) while both dry years (2007 and 2008) showed similar values in maximum, mean and standard deviation and unimodal distributions (around 0.75) of NDVI values. Positive linear adjustments were obtained between maximum (r2{\textgreater} 0.9) and mean NDVI (r2{\textgreater} 0.87) and the accumulated rainfall in the hydrological year and the mean water table depth from the last rainfall event till the date of the image acquisition. The spatial variations revealed that water table depth behaved different in wet and dry years. In dry years there was a remarkable increase in mean and maximum values linearly related to water table depth. The highest slope of the adjustment in 2007 indicated a sharp response of vegetation in the driest year. Monthly series of NDVI showed the major role of lack of precipitation through July and August in 2007 with missing classes of NDVI above 0.8 and unimodal distributions in mid-late summer. Best linear fits (r2close to 1) were obtained with rainfall at different temporal scales: accumulated rainfall in the hydrological year 2004 and accumulated rainfall in the last month previous to the date of 2007 image. Thus, in dry years productivity is closely related to water available from recent past as opposed to over the year for wet years. Good fits (r2values higher than 0.88) were obtained between monthly decrease in water table depth and NDVI variables just in the dry year. These results demonstrate the important feedback between woody vegetation response to changes in the freshwater lens using empirical data and could apply to other systems with strong directional gradients in resources. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, using an ensemble of hydrological and land-surface models, forced with bias-corrected downscaled general circulation model output, we estimate the impacts of 1–3 K global mean temperature increases on soil moisture droughts in Europe. Compared to the 1.5 K Paris target, an increase of 3 K—which represents current projected temperature change—is found to increase drought area by 40{\%} (±24{\%}), affecting up to 42{\%} (±22{\%}) more of the population. Furthermore, an event similar to the 2003 drought is shown to become twice as frequent; thus, due to their increased occurrence, events of this magnitude will no longer be classified as extreme. In the absence of effective mitigation, Europe will therefore face unprecedented increases in soil moisture drought, presenting new challenges for adaptation across the continent.},

The consultation on the United Nations post-2015 framework for disaster risk reduction highlights the need for cross-border early warning systems to strengthen the preparedness phases of disaster risk management, in order to save lives and property and reduce the overall impact of severe events. Continental and global scale flood forecasting systems provide vital early flood warning information to national and international civil protection authorities, who can use this information to make decisions on how to prepare for upcoming floods. Here the potential monetary benefits of early flood warnings are estimated based on the forecasts of the continental-scale European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) using existing flood damage cost information and calculations of potential avoided flood damages. The benefits are of the order of 400 Euro for every 1 Euro invested. A sensitivity analysis is performed in order to test the uncertainty in the method and develop an envelope of potential monetary benefits of EFAS warnings. The results provide clear evidence that there is likely a substantial monetary benefit in this cross-border continental-scale flood early warning system. This supports the wider drive to implement early warning systems at the continental or global scale to improve our resilience to natural hazards.},

abstract = {Computer models of hydrologic systems are frequently used to investigate the hydrologic response of landcover change. If the modeling results are used to inform resource-management decisions, then providing robust estimates of uncertainty in the simulated response is an important consideration. Here we examine the importance of parameterization, a necessarily subjective process, on uncertainty estimates of the simulated hydrologic response of landcover change. Specifically, we applied the soil water assessment tool (SWAT) model to a 1.4 km2 watershed in southern Texas to investigate the simulated hydrologic response of brush management (the mechanical removal of woody plants), a discrete land-cover change. The watershed was instrumented before and after brush-management activities were undertaken, and estimates of precipitation, streamflow, and evapotranspiration (ET) are available; these data were used to condition and verify the model. The role of parameterization in brush-management simulation was evaluated by constructing two models, one with 12 adjustable parameters (reduced parameterization) and one with 1305 adjustable parameters (full parameterization). Both models were subjected to global sensitivity analysis as well as Monte Carlo and generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) conditioning to identify important model inputs and to estimate uncertainty in several quantities of interest related to brush management. Many realizations from both parameterizations were identified as "behavioral" in that they reproduce daily mean streamflow acceptably well according to Nash- Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient, percent bias, and coefficient of determination. However, the total volumetric ET difference resulting from simulated brush management remains highly uncertain after conditioning to daily mean streamflow, indicating that streamflow data alone are not sufficient to inform the model inputs that influence the simulated outcomes of brush management the most. Additionally, the reduced-parameterization model grossly underestimates uncertainty in the total volumetric ET difference compared to the full-parameterization model; total volumetric ET difference is a primary metric for evaluating the outcomes of brush management. The failure of the reduced-parameterization model to provide robust uncertainty estimates demonstrates the importance of parameterization when attempting to quantify uncertainty in land-cover change simulations.},

abstract = {Estimates of flood event magnitudes with a certain return period are required for the design of hydraulic structures. While the return period is clearly defined in a univariate context, its definition is more challenging when the problem at hand requires considering the dependence between two or more variables in a multivariate framework. Several ways of defining a multivariate return period have been proposed in the literature, which all rely on different probability concepts. Definitions use the conditional probability, the joint probability, or can be based on the Kendall's distribution or survival function. In this study, we give a comprehensive overview on the tools that are available to define a return period in a multivariate context. We especially address engineers, practitioners, and people who are new to the topic and provide them with an accessible introduction to the topic. We outline the theoretical background that is needed when one is in a multivariate setting and present the reader with different definitions for a bivariate return period. Here, we focus on flood events and the different probability concepts are explained with a pedagogical, illustrative example of a flood event characterized by the two variables peak discharge and flood volume. The choice of the return period has an important effect on the magnitude of the design variable quantiles, which is illustrated with a case study in Switzerland. However, this choice is not arbitrary and depends on the problem at hand.For further resources related to this article, please visit the WIREs website.},

Resumen:
Se utiliza un modelo de random forest (RF) para predecir la influencia del cambio clim{\'{a}}tico en el {\'{a}}rea de ocupaci{\'{o}}n potencial de 20 especies arb{\'{o}}reas de la Pen{\'{i}}nsula Ib{\'{e}}rica en los horizontes 2020, 2050 y 2080.

M{\'{e}}todos:
Datos:
Se distinguen cuatro formaciones forestales en la Pen{\'{i}}nsula Ib{\'{e}}rica: bosques templados de frondosas, bosque templado de con{\'{i}}feras, bosque submediterr{\'{a}}neo y bosque mediterr{\'{a}}neo. Para cada una de estas formaciones se identifican las especies m{\'{a}}s representativas.
Como variables predictivas se utilizan la precipitaci{\'{o}}n y temperatura media anual y estacional, media de la temperatura m{\'{i}}nima del mes m{\'{a}}s fr{\'{i}}o y de la temperatura m{\'{a}}xima del mes m{\'{a}}s c{\'{a}}lido, as{\'{i}} como pendiente y orientaci{\'{o}}n.
La zona de estudio es toda la Pen{\'{i}}nsula Ib{\'{e}}rica a resoluci{\'{o}}n 1 km. Se generan mapas de ausencia-presencia de cada especie.
Modelo:
La t{\'{e}}cnica de clasificaci{\'{o}}n empleada es random forest (paquete de R randomForest). Como funci{\'{o}}n objetivo se utiliza el {\'{a}}rea bajo la curva ROC. El modelo reproduce mapas de probabilidad de presencia de las especies; los mapas de presencia-ausencia se generaron maximizando la estad{\'{i}}stica kappa.
Para la evaluaci{\'{o}}n del modelo se analiza la riqueza de especies (n{\textordmasculine} de especies en un pixel), el rango de contracci{\'{o}}n (n{\textordmasculine} de especies perdidas), rango de expaci{\'{o}}n (n{\textordmasculine} de especies ganadas) y la renovaci{\'{o}}n de especies (ganancia o p{\'{e}}rdida neta de especies).

Resultados:
Rendimiento
Rendimientos altos de RF con AUC por encima de 0.93 y coeficiente kappa por encima de 0.5.
Distribuci{\'{o}}n de especies
El bosque templado de con{\'{i}}feras subrir{\'{a}} una reducci{\'{o}}n intensa y r{\'{a}}pida de su rango, mostrando una capacidad limitada para expandir su rango a otras {\'{a}}reas al no haber zonas a suficiente altitud.
El bosque templado de frondosas tambi{\'{e}}n se ver{\'{a}} notablemente reducida, no tan marcada en el caso del casta{\~{n}}o y el roble com{\'{u}}n. Esta formaci{\'{o}}n tiene mayor capacidad de adaptaci{\'{o}}n por desplazamiento altitudinal.
El bosque submediterr{\'{a}}neo. El chopo y el robollo sufrir{\'{a}}n un declive importante, no as{\'{i}} el roble pubescente.
El bosque mediterr{\'{a}}neo es el que sufrir{\'{a}} una menor reducci{\'{o}}n de su {\'{a}}rea ocupada. Pereder{\'{a}} parte de su {\'{a}}rea actual, pero colonizar{\'{a}} zonas actualmente ocupadas por bosque submediterr{\'{e}}neo. Tambi{\'{e}}n se observa un desplazamiento en altitud y latitud.
Biodiversidad
La mayor riqueza forestal se concentrar{\'{a}} en las monta{\~{n}}as, siendo estas zonas las que tambi{\'{e}}n sufren mayor contracci{\'{o}}n y expansi{\'{o}}n.

Limitaciones:
El modelo predice las distribuciones potenciales de las especies bas{\'{a}}ndose {\'{u}}nicamente en el clima, pero no tiene en cuenta la fragmentaci{\'{o}}n del h{\'{a}}bitat debido a la acci{\'{o}}n humana y al cambio de usos del suelo. Habr{\'{i}}a que incluir la competencia entre especies para generar un {\'{u}}nico mapa de distribuciones de vegetaci{\'{o}}n.
Limitaciones debida a los criterios objetivos y a la suposici{\'{o}}n de que el modelo que mejor representa el presente tambi{\'{e}}n es representativo del futuro.
Una de las mayores limitaciones es que los rangos utilizados para entrenar el modelo no corresponde con el rango ecol{\'{o}}gico completo de la especie (esto explica por qu{\'{e}} al combinar datos de PdE y SdG el modelo funcionaba mejor).},

abstract = {The multi-metric assessment of model performance in a dominantly single-domain modeling approach (i.e., surface) may not be sufficient to gauge the validity of the model to represent the hydrologic system. Consequently, rating metrics can mathematically validate model results as satisfactory even when some of the simulated hydrologic processes are incorrectly represented during the calibration process. In this paper, we argue that to properly represent the hydrologic system, calibration tasks focused on modifying model parameters should account for equifinality, model inadequacy, and constraint inadequacy. To demonstrate our argument, we conducted a traditional calibration using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) coupled to the Modular Finite-difference Flow Model (MODFLOW) to simulate the hydrologic processes in the Fort Cobb Reservoir Experimental Watershed (FCREW) in central western Oklahoma. The results indicated that model calibration based on metrics from a single domain, in this case using SWAT, did not necessarily guarantee an appropriate representation of water circulation. Moreover, unsupervised calibration techniques based on the objective-function optimization (e.g., inverse calibration using SWAT-CUP SUFI2 algorithm) may not be sufficient if model constraints in multiple domains are not properly set, resulting in distorted parameters. This practice can result in the misrepresentation of water circulation and can have adverse impacts on environmental model results used to support policies and decisions.},

abstract = {In the context of global environmental and social change, with increasing pollution and decline of biodiversity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems having its deep roots in drastic modifications to hydrological mesocycles, there is an urgent need for a new approach for sustainability. The two often contradicting approaches to water resources management, i.e., (1) hydrotechnical, and (2) ecological, can be reconciled within the context of ecohydrology (EH). It seeks for the understanding of the underlying water-biota interactions as well as providing a new tool for management of water resources. While the majority of changes are nonreversible in the framework of ecohydrology it is possible to regulate (dual regulation) the processes, especially in novel ecosystems, as an alternative to conservation and restoration measures, in order to increase their carrying capacity in the four dimensions, as follows: (1) water resources, (2) biodiversity, (3) ecosystem services, and (4) resilience. The proposed approach aims to initiate a discussion and joint efforts of hydrological engineers, hydrologists, and ecologists towards formulation of the comprehensive strategy and scientific background for harmonization of society needs with the enhanced ecosystem potential. It stipulates for a change in paradigm not only in the environmental sciences but also in the global economy, engineering, and education systems.},

The availability of several global ensemble weather prediction systems through the "THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble" (TIGGE) archive provides an opportunity to explore new dimensions in early flood forecasting and warning. TIGGE data has been used as meteorological input to the European Flood Alert System (EFAS) for a case study of a flood event in Romania in October 2007. Results illustrate that awareness for this case of flooding could have been raised as early as 8 days before the event and how the subsequent forecasts provide increasing insight into the range of possible flood conditions. This first assessment of one flood event illustrates the potential value of the TIGGE archive and the grand-ensembles approach to raise preparedness and thus to reduce the socio-economic impact of floods.

abstract = {Increased availability and quality of near real-time observations provide the opportunity to improve understanding of predictive skills of hydrologic models. Recent studies have shown the limited capability of river discharge data alone to adequately constrain different components of distributed model parameterizations. In this study, the GRACE satellite-based total water storage (TWS) anomaly is used to complement the discharge data with the aim to improve the fidelity of mesoscale hydrologic model (mHM) through multivariate parameter estimation. The study is conducted on 83 European basins covering a wide range of hydroclimatic regimes. The model parameterization complemented with the TWS anomalies leads to statistically significant improvements in (1) discharge simulations during low-flow period, and (2) evapotranspiration estimates which are evaluated against independent data (FLUXNET). Overall, there is no significant deterioration in model performance for the discharge simulations when complemented by information from the TWS anomalies. However, considerable changes in the partitioning of precipitation into runoff components are noticed by in-/exclusion of TWS during the parameter estimation. Introducing monthly averaged TWS data only improves the dynamics of streamflow on monthly or longer time scales, which mostly addresses the dynamical behavior of the base flow reservoir. A cross-evaluation test carried out to assess the transferability of the calibrated parameters to other locations further confirms the benefit of complementary TWS data. In particular, the evapotranspiration estimates show more robust performance when TWS data are incorporated during the parameter estimation, in comparison with the benchmark model constrained against discharge only. This study highlights the value for incorporating multiple data sources during parameter estimation to improve the overall realism of hydrologic models and their applications over large domains. VC},

Digital elevation data are used to model topographic controls on incoming solar radiation, air temperature, precipitation, and downslope water movement. Canopy evapotranspiration is represented via a two-layer Penman-Monteith formulation that incorporates local net solar radiation, surface meteorology, soil characteristics and moisture status, and species-dependent leaf area index and stomatal resistance. Snow accumulation and ablation are modeled using an energy balance approach that includes the effects of local topography and vegetation cover. Saturated subsurface flow is modeled using a quasi three-dimensional routing scheme. The model was applied at a 180-m scale to the Middle Fork Flathead River basin in northwestern Montana. This 2900-km2, snowmelt- dominated watershed ranges in elevation from 900 to over 3000 m. The model was calibrated using 2 years of recorded precipitation and streamflow. The model was verified against 2 additional years of runoff and against advanced very high resolution radiometer based spatial snow cover data at the 1-km 2 scale. Simulated discharge showed acceptable agreement with observations. The simulated areal patterns of snow cover were in general agreement with the remote sensing observations, but were lagged slightly in time. 1.},

The stochastic representation is based on three-component stochastic point processes which possess the general features of the embedding of rain cells within small mesoscale areas within large mesoscale areas within synoptic storms. Certain scale idealizations, and assumptions on functional forms which qualita- tively reflect the physical features, lead to a closed form expression for the covariance function, i.e., the' real space-time spectrum, of the rainfall intensity field. The theoretical spectrum explains the empirical spectral features observed by Zawadzki almost a decade ago. Of particular interest and importance in this connection is an explanation of the empirical observation that the Taylorian propogation of the fine scale structure, via a transformation of time to space through the storm velocity, holds only for a small time lag and not throughout. The results here indicate the extent of this lag in terms of the characteristic scales associated with cell durations, cellular birthrates and velocities, etc},

This is the first LSTM application on Danish data. The results were benchmarked against the Danish national water resources model (DK-model), a physically based hydrological model. The median Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), a common metric to assess performance of runoff predictions (optimum of 1), increased from 0.7 (DK-model) to 0.8 (LSTM) when trained against all catchments. Overall, the LSTM outperformed the DK-model in 80{\%} of catchments. Despite the compelling KGE evaluation, the water balance closure was modelled less accurately by the LSTM. The applicability of LSTM networks for modelling ungauged catchments was assessed via a spatial split-sample experiment. A 20{\%} spatial hold-out showed poorer performance of the LSTM with respect to the DK model. However, after pre-training, that is, weight initialisation obtained from training against simulated data from the DK-model, the performance of the LSTM was effectively improved. This formed a convincing argument supporting the knowledge-guided machine learning (ML) paradigm to integrate physically based models and ML to train robust models that generalise well.},

abstract = {A new computation framework (BIOMOD: BIOdiversity MODelling) is presented, which aims to maximize the predictive accuracy of current species distributions and the reliability of future potential distributions using different types of statistical modelling methods. BIOMOD capitalizes on the different techniques used in static modelling to provide spatial predictions. It computes, for each species and in the same package, the four most widely used modelling techniques in species predictions, namely Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Classification and Regression Tree analysis (CART) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). BIOMOD was applied to 61 species of trees in Europe using climatic quantities as explanatory variables of current distributions. On average, all the different modelling methods yielded very good agreement between observed and predicted distributions. However, the relative performance of different techniques was idiosyncratic across species, suggesting that the most accurate model varies between species. The results of this evaluation also highlight that slight differences between current predictions from different modelling techniques are exacerbated in future projections. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the reliability of alternative projections without validation techniques or expert opinion. It is concluded that rather than using a single modelling technique to predict the distribution of several species, it would be more reliable to use a framework assessing different models for each species and selecting the most accurate one using both evaluation methods and expert knowledge.},

Resumen:
Se presenta el modelo BIOMOD, que utiliza cuatro t{\'{e}}cnicas (GLM, GAM, CART, NN) para la predicci{\'{o}}n de distribuciones de especies. Se muestra el estudio realizado a nivel europeo para reproducir la distribuci{\'{o}}n espacial de 61 especies a partir de variables clim{\'{a}}ticas y predecir c{\'{o}}mo variar{\'{a}} esa distruci{\'{o}}n en un escenario de cambio clim{\'{a}}tico.

Teor{\'{i}}a:
Modelos est{\'{a}}ticos empleados:
- Generalized Linear Models (GLM).
- Generalized Additive Models (GAM).
- Classification and Regression Tress (CART).
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

M{\'{e}}todos:
Se toman datos de las 61 especies de {\'{a}}rboles del Atlas Flora Europaeae en 4419 celdas de 50 km de resoluci{\'{o}}n.
Los datos clim{\'{a}}ticos se obtuvieron del Climatic Research Unit: precipitaci{\'{o}} nedia del a{\~{n}}o, el invierno y el verano; temperatura media anual y m{\'{i}}nima del mes m{\'{a}}s fr{\'{i}}o; grados d{\'{i}}as de crecimiento ({\textgreater}5{\textordmasculine}C); {\'{i}}ndice de humedad (cociente de la ET real y la potencial anual). Para el an{\'{a}}lisis a futuro se usan estas variables para un escenario de cambio clim{\'{a}}tico.
Modelos predictivos:
- GLM con polinomios de primer, segundo y tercer orden. Se tuiliza un proceso paso a paso para extraer las variables m{\'{a}}s significativas mediante el criterio AIC.
- GAM con splines. El mismo proceso paso a paso de selecci{\'{o}}n de variables.
- CART con validaci{\'{o}}n cruzada en 10 partes para seleccionar el mejor n{\'{u}}mero de hojas.
- ANN prealimentada con una {\'{u}}nica capa de 7 neuronas y un peso de decaimiento de 0.03. El modelo final es la media de las 10 simulaciones.
El rendimiento de los modelos se mide mediante el {\'{a}}rea bajo la curva ROC (AUC) y la estad{\'{i}}stica $\kappa$. El primer criterio tiene la ventaja de no necesitar un umbral para transformar la probabilidad en presencia/ausencia.
Modelos de proyecci{\'{o}}n:
Sobre los modelos calibrados, se aplican las variables clim{\'{a}}ticas futuras. El an{\'{a}}lisis posterior se centra en cuatro esp{\'{e}}cies arb{\'{o}}reas caracter{\'{i}}sticas de cuatro climas europeos: roble albar como especie eurosiberiana, casta{\~{n}}o como continental, pino carrasco como mediterr{\'{a}}nea y abedul enano como siberiana.

Resultados:
Modelos predictivos:
Todos los modelos muestran buen rendimiento tanto para AUC como $\kappa$. ANN es ligeramente el mejor y CART el peor. Tanto CART como ANN tienden a sobreajustar el modelo, mientras que GAM y GLM no. Aunque ANN tiene el mejor rendimiento global, GLM y GAM le superan en ciertas especies arb{\'{o}}reas, por lo que no se puede definir un modelo universalmente mejor.
Modelos de proyecci{\'{o}}n:
En general se observa la esperada expansi{\'{o}}n forestal hacia el norte.
Las proyecciones de roble albar demuestran que peque{\~{n}}os cambios en el rendimiento en la predicci{\'{o}}n suponen grandes cambios en la proyecci{\'{o}}n a futuro.
Para el casta{\~{n}}o GLM, GAM y ANN proyectan una expansi{\'{o}}n hacia el norte y contracci{\'{o}}n en el sur, mientras que CART proyecta una distribuci{\'{o}}n estable.
Para el pino carrasco los modelos estad{\'{i}}sticos (GLM y GAM) proyectan una expansi{\'{o}}n al norte y contracci{\'{o}} en el sureste y suoreste. Por el contrario, los modelos basados en reglas (CART y ANN) no proyectan dicha contracci{\'{o}}n.
Todos los modelos proyectan una considerable reducci{\'{o}}n del h{\'{a}}bitat del abedul enano en el sur.

Discusi{\'{o}}n:
- La fiabilidad de las proyecciones futuras depende sustancialmente de la t{\'{e}}cnica empleada.
- BIOMOD utiliza cuatro t{\'{e}}cnicas diferentes tanto para la predicci{\'{o}}n como la proyecci{\'{o}}n, con lo que los resultados son m{\'{a}}s fialbles.

Mejoras:
- Utilizaci{\'{o}}n de algoritmos gen{\'{e}}ticos.

Limitaciones:
Tres fuentes de incertidumbre: los escenarios de cambio clim{\'{a}}tico, las t{\'{e}}cnicas empleadas y el umbral que transforma probabilidad en presencia-ausencia.
- Esta aproximaci{\'{o}}n encuentra de forma independiente el h{\'{a}}bitat potencial de una especie, pero no hay interacci{\'{o}}n entre especies. Ser{\'{i}}a necesario que los mapas interactuasen como hace Jose (realizaed AOO vs potential AOO) de manera que se obtenga un mapa {\'{u}}nico de distribuci{\'{o}}n de especies.},

abstract = {Vegetation and the water cycles are inherently coupled across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Water availability interacts with plant ecophysiology and controls vegetation functioning. Concurrently, vegetation has direct and indirect effects on energy, water, carbon, and nutrient cycles. To better understand and model plant–water interactions, highly interdisciplinary approaches are required. We present an overview of the main processes and relevant interactions between water and plants across a range of spatial scales, from the cell level of leaves, where stomatal controls occur, to drought stress at the level of a single tree, to the integrating scales of a watershed, region, and the globe. A review of process representations in models at different scales is presented. More specifically, three main model families are identified: (1) models of plant hydraulics that mechanistically simulate stomatal controls and/or water transport at the tree level; (2) ecohydrological models that simulate plot- to catchment-scale water, energy, and carbon fluxes; and (3) terrestrial biosphere models that simulate carbon, water, and nutrient dynamics at the regional and global scales and address feedback between Earth's vegetation and the climate system. We identify special features and similarities across the model families. Examples of where plant–water interactions are especially important and have led to key scientific findings are also highlighted. Finally, we discuss the various data sources that are currently available to force and validate existing models, and we present perspectives on the evolution of the field.},

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis is an essential paradigm in Earth and Environmental Systems modeling. However, the term ‘‘sensitivity'' has a clear definition, based in partial derivatives, only when specified locally around a particular point (e.g., optimal solution) in the problem space. Accordingly, no unique defi- nition exists for ‘‘global sensitivity'' across the problem space, when considering one or more model responses to different factors such as model parameters or forcings. A variety of approaches have been proposed for global sensitivity analysis, based on different philosophies and theories, and each of these formally characterizes a different ‘‘intuitive'' understanding of sensitivity. These approaches focus on dif- ferent properties of the model response at a fundamental level and may therefore lead to different (even conflicting) conclusions about the underlying sensitivities. Here we revisit the theoretical basis for sensi- tivity analysis, summarize and critically evaluate existing approaches in the literature, and demonstrate their flaws and shortcomings through conceptual examples. We also demonstrate the difficulty involved in interpreting ‘‘global'' interaction effects, which may undermine the value of existing interpretive approaches. With this background, we identify several important properties of response surfaces that are associated with the understanding and interpretation of sensitivities in the context of Earth and Environ- mental System models. Finally, we highlight the need for a new, comprehensive framework for sensitivity analysis that effectively characterizes all of the important sensitivity-related properties of model response surfaces.

abstract = {Different postprocessing techniques are frequently employed to improve the outcome of ensemble forecasting models. The main reason is to compensate for biases caused by errors in model structure or initial conditions, and as a correction for under-or overdispersed ensembles. Here we use the ensemble model output statistics method to postprocess the ensemble output from a continental-scale hydrological model, LISFLOOD, as used in the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS). We develop a method for local calibration and interpolation of the postprocessing parameters and compare it with a more traditional global calibration approach for 678 stations in Europe based on long-term observations of runoff and meteorological variables. For the global calibration we also test a reduced model with only a variance inflation factor. Whereas the postprocessing improved the results for the first 1–2 days lead time, the improvement was less for increasing lead times of the verification period. This was the case both for the local and global calibration methods. As the postprocessing is based on assumptions about the distribution of forecast errors, we also present an analysis of the ensemble output that provides some indications of what to expect from the postprocessing.},
annote = {Objectives

*To interpolate locally calibrated postprocessing parameters with the geostatistical method  top-kriging.
* To analyse the  effect of transformation methods such as Box-Cox or GEV in the forecast      skill.

Data

Forecast

3 years discharge      (2015-2017) with up to 10 days lead time simulated with LISFLOOD. A total      of 69 simulations: 1 ECMWF deterministic, 51 ECMWF stochastic, 1 DWD, 16      COSMO-LEPS

Observations

discharge proxy      simulated with LISFLOOD using interpolated observed precipitation and      temperature.

Methods

Transformations

To apply postprocessing data must be normally distributed. Several transformation methods are tested (normal score transformation, versions of Box-Cox transformation, versions of GEV...) on the discharge data.

Ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) (Gneiting et al., 2005)
Its objective is to minimize the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). The forecast will be calculated as a weighted mean of the ensembles. Optimizing that linear equation will render an unbiased mean forecast, but variance must also be optimize, for which another linear approximation is used. In that way, the CRPS can be analitically solved supposing that the predictive distribution functions is normal.
Top-kriging to interpolate parameters
It is applied to spatial variables (in this case specific discharge) to include in the interpolation the varying spatial support.

EMOS calibration

* Global calibration: one set      of EMOS parameters for the entire region
* Local calibration:      individually for each location. To avoid equifinality, a spatial penalty      is tested, to induce the calibration into similar parameter sets in      neighboring catchments.
* SCEUA
* 1 year calibration      period

Validation

* Case 1:  difference in the calibration results between methods.
* Case 2: cross-validation to identify sources of error.
* Case 3: temporal verification.
* Case 4: spatiotemporal cross-validation.

The score used is the continuous ranked probability skill score (CRPSS). The benchmark is the mean of the forecasts (ensembles are previously averaged) and the variance of a global ensemble. They also use probability integral transformation (PIT) as a visual indicator.

Conclusions:

Objective 1

the spatial      interpolation of parameters could be useful if there was stronger need for      postprocessing

Objective 2

none of the      transformations give substantially better results
Since an operational service requires simplicity, only calibration the variance inflation factor would be the best option.},

abstract = {MIKE SHE is one of the most extensively used physically based distributed hydrological models that are capable of credibly interpreting the response mechanism of ecohydrological processes to ecosystem components and organization. However, implementing MIKE SHE in integrated catchment modeling is a complex task requiring an experienced modeling team with skills in a variety of disciplines, making it difficult for scientists without a background in hydrology or computer science to utilize this useful model. This review, from the perspective of ecology and environmental science, illustrates the important role of a physically based distributed model as a solution to issues related to ecohydrological processes, offering a major discussion of issues that received little attention from the previous reviewers and that would interest researchers without a hydrology background. The inevitable and possible difficulties confronting these potential users at the beginning and early stages of utilizing the model are also brought to light, with suggestions for solutions. This paper offers a brief review of MIKE SHE development and elaborates its main merits, key problems, and research on the model's theories and practices implemented by scholars. Lingering problems in current solutions are analyzed, and potential approaches to solutions are proposed. We hope that this paper provides some practical advice to researchers who want to initiate study of water issues related to modeling ecohydrological processes by employing MIKE SHE.},

abstract = {Dams and reservoirs are among the most widespread human-made infrastructures on Earth. Despite their societal and environmental significance, spatial inventories of dams and reservoirs, even for the large ones, are insufficient. A dilemma of the existing georeferenced dam datasets is the polarized focus on either dam quantity and spatial coverage (e.g., GlObal geOreferenced Database of Dams, GOODD) or detailed attributes for a limited dam quantity or region (e.g., GRanD (Global Reservoir and Dam database) and national inventories). One of the most comprehensive datasets, the World Register of Dams (WRD), maintained by the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD), documents nearly 60g000 dams with an extensive suite of attributes. Unfortunately, the WRD records provide no geographic coordinates, limiting the benefits of their attributes for spatially explicit applications. To bridge the gap between attribute accessibility and spatial explicitness, we introduce the Georeferenced global Dams And Reservoirs (GeoDAR) dataset, created by utilizing the Google Maps geocoding application programming interface (API) and multi-source inventories. We release GeoDAR in two successive versions (v1.0 and v1.1) at 10.5281/zenodo.6163413 (Wang et al., 2022). GeoDAR v1.0 holds 22g560 dam points georeferenced from the WRD, whereas v1.1 consists of (a) 24g783 dam points after a harmonization between GeoDAR v1.0 and GRanD v1.3 and (b) 21g515 reservoir polygons retrieved from high-resolution water masks based on a one-to-one relationship between dams and reservoirs. Due to geocoding challenges, GeoDAR spatially resolved g1/4g40g{\%} of the records in the WRD, which, however, comprise over 90g{\%} of the total reservoir area, catchment area, and reservoir storage capacity. GeoDAR does not release the proprietary WRD attributes, but upon individual user requests we may provide assistance in associating GeoDAR spatial features with the WRD attribute information that users have acquired from ICOLD. Despite this limit, GeoDAR, with a dam quantity triple that of GRanD, significantly enhances the spatial details of smaller but more widespread dams and reservoirs and complements other existing global dam inventories. Along with its extended attribute accessibility, GeoDAR is expected to benefit a broad range of applications in hydrologic modeling, water resource management, ecosystem health, and energy planning.},

abstract = {Changes in spring and autumn phenology of temperate plants in recent decades have become iconic bio-indicators of rapid climate change. These changes have substantial ecological and economic impacts. However, autumn phenology remains surprisingly little studied. Although the effects of unfavorable environmental conditions (e.g., frost, heat, wetness, and drought) on autumn phenology have been observed for over 60 y, how these factors interact to influence autumn phenological events remain poorly understood. Using remotely sensed phenology data from 2001 to 2012, this study identified and quantified significant effects of a suite of environmental factors on the timing of fall dormancy of deciduous forest communities in New England, United States. Cold, frost, and wet conditions, and high heat-stress tended to induce earlier dormancy of deciduous forests, whereas moderate heat- and drought-stress delayed dormancy. Deciduous forests in two eco-regions showed contrasting, nonlinear responses to variation in these explanatory factors. Based on future climate projection over two periods (2041–2050 and 2090–2099), later dormancy dates were predicted in northern areas. However, in coastal areas earlier dormancy dates were predicted. Our models suggest that besides warming in climate change, changes in frost and moisture conditions as well as extreme weather events (e.g., drought- and heat-stress, and flooding), should also be considered in future predictions of autumn phenology in temperate deciduous forests. This study improves our understanding of how multiple environmental variables interact to affect autumn phenology in temperate deciduous forest ecosystems, and points the way to building more mechanistic and predictive models. },

abstract = {The USDA-Agricultural Research Service's Experimental Watershed Network grew from Dust Bowl era efforts of the Soil Conservation Service in the mid 1930's with the establishment of watersheds in three States; one of which is still in operation. In the mid-50's five centers with intensively instrumented watersheds at the scale of 100 to 700 km2 were established. Primary network research objectives were to quantify the field-scale and downstream effects of conservation practices and develop rainfall-runoff relationships for design of water conservation structures. USDA-ARS has operated over 600 watersheds in its history and continues to operate roughly 120 watersheds, many of which consist of gauged subwatersheds nested within larger gauged watersheds to enable investigation of scaling. With passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, research objectives have evolved to add a variety of observations relevant to the water quality issues in their respective regions resulting in a more diverse, but less homogeneous network. The core instrumentation and related long record of high-quality observations have led to initiation of a series of multi-location projects to examine trends and directions of these observations across the network. As a result of their long history, intensive monitoring, and well described processes, the USDA-ARS watersheds have been used extensively in the development and validation of numerous watershed models. In addition, they served, and continue to serve as validation sites for aircraft and satellite based remotely sensed instruments. Many of the USDA-ARS Experimental Watersheds have now joined the Long-Term Agro-ecosystem Research Network (LTAR) (Maddox, 2013). This presentation will review major activities and advances derived from the network in addition to discussing some lessons learned in the long-term operation of a national scale network through its evolution from analog to digital instrumentation and internet accessibility.},

abstract = {Commonly used bias correction methods such as quantile mapping (QM) assume the function of error correction values between modeled and observed distributions are stationary or time invariant. This article finds that this function of the error correction values cannot be assumed to be stationary. As a result, QM lacks justification to inflate/deflate various moments of the climate change signal. Previous adaptations of QM, most notably quantile delta mapping (QDM), have been developed that do not rely on this assumption of stationarity. Here, we outline a methodology called scaled distribution mapping (SDM), which is conceptually similar to QDM, but more explicitly accounts for the frequency of rain days and the likelihood of individual events. The SDM method is found to outperform QM, QDM, and detrended QM in its ability to better preserve raw climate model projected changes to meteorological variables such as temperature and precipitation.},

abstract = {A global river discharge simulation was conducted that accounted for 452 individually operated reservoirs by locating them on the digital global river network map of TRIP, a global river routing model. An operating rule was determined for each reservoir using a newly-developed algorithm that used currently available global data such as reservoir storage capacity, intended purposes, simulated inflow, and water demand in the lower reaches. This algorithm reduced the root mean square error of reservoir release and river discharge simulations from that of earlier global river discharge simulations that neglected reservoir operations or substituted an algorithm for natural-lake outflow. The 2-year global simulation results indicate that reservoir operations substantially altered monthly discharge for individual basins (i.e., by more than 20{\%}). Averaged over the continental scale, the maximum change in monthly river discharge varied from 0{\%} to 34{\%} and the changes in reservoir storage were small as a proportion of the total storage capacity. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A number of watershed-scale hydrological models include Richards' equation (RE) solutions, but the literature is sparse on information as to the appropriate application of RE at the watershed scale. In most published applications of RE in distributed watershed-scale hydrological modelling, coarse vertical resolutions are used to decrease the computational burden. Compared to point- or field-scale studies, application at the watershed scale is complicated by diverse runoff production mechanisms, groundwater effects on runoff production, runon phenomena and heterogeneous watershed characteristics. An essential element of the numerical solution of RE is that the solution converges as the spatial resolution increases. Spatial convergence studies can be used to identify the proper resolution that accurately describes the solution with maximum computational efficiency, when using physically realistic parameter values. In this study, spatial convergence studies are conducted using the two-dimensional, distributed-parameter, gridded surface subsurface hydrological analysis (GSSHA) model, which solves RE to simulate vadose zone fluxes. Tests to determine if the required discretization is strongly a function of dominant runoff production mechanism are conducted using data from two very different watersheds, the Hortonian Goodwin Creek Experimental Watershed and the non-Hortonian Muddy Brook watershed. Total infiltration, stream flow and evapotranspiration for the entire simulation period are used to compute comparison statistics. The influences of upper and lower boundary conditions on the solution accuracy are also explored. Results indicate that to simulate hydrological fluxes accurately at both watersheds small vertical cell sizes, of the order of 1 cm, are required near the soil surface, but not throughout the soil column. The appropriate choice of approximations for calculating the near soil-surface unsaturated hydraulic conductivity can yield modest increases in the required cell size. Results for both watersheds are quite similar, even though the soils and runoff production mechanisms differ greatly between the two catchments.

abstract = {Earth's vegetation plays a pivotal role in the global water balance. Hence, there is a need to model dynamic interactions and feedbacks between the terrestrial biosphere and the water cycle. Here, the hydrological performance of the Lund-Potsdam-Jena model (LPJ), a prominent dynamic global vegetation model, is evaluated. Models of this type simulate the coupled terrestrial carbon and water cycle, thus they are well suited for investigating biosphere-hydrosphere interactions over large domains. We demonstrate that runoff and evapotranspiration computed by LPJ agree well with respective results from state-of-the-art global hydrological models, while in some regions, runoff is significantly over- or underestimated compared to observations. The direction and magnitude of these biases is largely similar to those from other macro-scale models, rather than specific to LPJ. They are attributable primarily to uncertainties in the climate input data, and to human interventions not considered by the model (e.g. water withdrawal, land cover conversions). Additional model development is required to perform integrated assessments of water exchanges among the biosphere, the hydrosphere, and the anthroposphere. Yet, the LPJ model can now be used to study inter-relations between the world's major vegetation types and the terrestrial water balance. As an example, it is shown that a doubling of atmospheric CO2 content alone would result in pronounced changes in evapotranspiration and runoff for many parts of the world. Although significant, these changes would remain unseen by stand-alone hydrological models, thereby emphasizing the importance of simulating the coupled carbon and water cycle. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Land use change has important consequences for biodiversity and the sustainability of ecosystem services, as well as for global environmental change. Spatially explicit land use change models improve our understanding of the processes driving change and make predictions about the quantity and location of future and past change. Here we present the lulccR package, an object-oriented framework for land use change modelling written in the R programming language. The contribution of the work is to resolve the following limitations associated with the current land use change modelling paradigm: (1) the source code for model implementations is frequently unavailable, severely compromising the reproducibility of scientific results and making it impossible for members of the community to improve or adapt models for their own purposes; (2) ensemble experiments to capture model structural uncertainty are difficult because of fundamental differences between implementations of different models; (3) different aspects of the modelling procedure must be performed in different environments because existing applications usually only perform the spatial allocation of change. The package includes a stochastic ordered allocation procedure as well as an implementation of the widely used CLUE-S algorithm. We demonstrate its functionality by simulating land use change at the Plum Island Ecosystems site, using a dataset included with the package. It is envisaged that lulccR will enable future model development and comparison within an open environment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This work emphasizes the coupled nature of vegetation-water-energy dynamics by considering linkages at timescales that vary from hourly to interannual. A series of two papers is presented. A dynamic ecohydrological model [tRIBS + VEGGIE] is described in this paper. It reproduces essential water and energy processes over the complex topography of a river basin and links them to the basic plant life regulatory processes. The framework focuses on ecohydrology of semiarid environments exhibiting abundant input of solar energy but limiting soil water that correspondingly affects vegetation structure and organization. The mechanisms through which water limitation influences plant dynamics are related to carbon assimilation via the control of photosynthesis and stomatal behavior, carbon allocation, stress-induced foliage loss, as well as recruitment and phenology patterns. This first introductory paper demonstrates model performance using observations for a site located in a semiarid environment of central New Mexico.},

However, in operational applications the available information is quite limited. Therefore parsimonious models together with available satellite information can be valuable tools to predict vegetation dynamics. In this work, we focus on a parsimonious model aimed to simulate vegetation and hydrological dynamics, using both field measurements and satellite information to implement it. The results suggest that the model is able to adequately reproduce the dynamics of vegetation as well as the soil moisture variations. In other words, it has been shown that a parsimonious model with simple equations can achieve good results in general terms and it is possible to assimilate satellite and field observations for the model implementation.},

abstract = {This innovative study presents concepts and problems in soil physics, and provides solutions using original computer programs. It provides a close examination of physical environments of soil, including an analysis of the movement of heat, water and gases. The authors employ the programming language Python, which is now widely used for numerical problem solving in the sciences. In contrast to the majority of the literature on soil physics, this text focuses on solving, not deriving, differential equations for transport. Using numerical procedures to solve differential equations allows the solution of quite difficult problems with fairly simple mathematical tools. Numerical methods convert differential into algebraic equations, which can be solved using conventional methods of linear algebra. Each chapter introduces a soil physics concept, and proceeds to develop computer programs to solve the equations and illustrate the points made in the discussion.Problems at the end of each chapter help the reader practise using the concepts introduced. The text is suitable for advanced undergraduates, graduates and researchers of soil physics. It employs an open source philosophy where computer code is presented, explained and discussed, and provides the reader with a full understanding of the solutions. Once mastered, the code can be adapted and expanded for the user's own models, fostering further developments. The Python tools provide a simple syntax, Object Oriented Programming techniques, powerful mathematical and numerical tools, and a user friendly environment.},

abstract = {Identification of the flood frequency curve in ungauged basins is usually performed by means of regional models based on the grouping of data recorded at various gauging stations. The present work aims at implementing a regional procedure that overcomes some of the limitations of the standard approaches and adds a clearer representation of the uncertainty components of the estimation.The information in the sample records is summarized in a set of sample L-moments, that become the variables to be regionalized. To transfer the information to ungauged basins we adopt a regional model for each of the L-moments, based on a comprehensive multiple regression approach. The independent variables of the regression are selected among a large number of geomorpholoclimatic catchment descriptors. Each model is calibrated on the entire dataset of stations using non-standard least-squares techniques accounting for the sample variability of L-moments, without resorting to any grouping procedure to create sub-regions. In this way, L-moments are allowed to vary smoothly from site to site in the descriptor space, following the variation of the descriptors selected in the regression models. This approach overcomes the subjectivity affecting the techniques for the definition and verification of the homogeneous regions. In addition, the method provides accurate confidence bands for the frequency curves estimated in ungauged basins.The procedure has been applied to a vast region in North-Western Italy (about 30,000km2). Cross-validation techniques are used to assess the efficiency of this approach in reconstructing the flood frequency curves, demonstrating the feasibility and the robustness of the approach. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Nevertheless, quantitative assessment of climate$\backslash$nchange impacts is still a complex task. The aim of this study was to$\backslash$nimplement a sediment model by taking advantage of sediment proxy$\backslash$ninformation provided by reservoir bottom deposits and to use it for$\backslash$nclimate change assessment in a Mediterranean catchment.$\backslash$nThe sediment model was utilised in a catchment that drains into a large$\backslash$nreservoir. The depositional history of the reservoir was reconstructed$\backslash$nand used for sediment sub-model implementation. The model results were$\backslash$ncompared with gauged suspended sediment data in order to verify model$\backslash$nrobustness. Then, the model was coupled with future precipitation and$\backslash$ntemperature scenarios obtained from climate models. Climatological model$\backslash$noutputs for two emission scenarios (A2 and B2) were simulated and the$\backslash$nresults compared with a reference scenario.$\backslash$nModel results showed a general decrease in soil moisture and water$\backslash$ndischarge. Large floods, which are responsible for the majority of$\backslash$nsediment mobilisation, also showed a general decrease. Sediment yield$\backslash$nshowed a clear reduction under the A2 scenario but increased under the$\backslash$nB2 scenario. The computed specific sediment yield for the control period$\backslash$nwas 6.33 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), while for the A2 and B2 scenarios, it was$\backslash$n3.62 and 7.04 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. Furthermore, sediment$\backslash$ntransport showed an increase in its time compression, i.e. a stronger$\backslash$ndependence of total sediment yield from the largest event contributions.$\backslash$nThis study shows a methodology for implementing a distributed sediment$\backslash$nmodel by exploiting reservoir sedimentation volumes. This methodology$\backslash$ncan be applied to a wide range of catchments, given the high$\backslash$navailability of reservoir sedimentation data. Moreover, this study$\backslash$nshowed how such a model can be used in the framework of a climate change$\backslash$nstudy, providing a measure of the impact of climate change on soil$\backslash$nerosion and sediment yields.},

abstract = {A method is presented for using dissolved CFCs or SF6 to estimate the apparent age of stream base flow by indirectly estimating the mean concentration of the tracer in the inflowing groundwater. The mean value is estimated simultaneously with the mean residence times of the gas and water in the stream by sampling the stream for one or both age tracers, along with dissolved nitrogen and argon at a single location over a period of approximately 12–14 h. The data are fitted to an equation representing the tempo- ral in-stream gas exchange as it responds to the diurnal temperature fluctuation. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated by collecting and analyzing samples at six different stream locations across parts of north- ern Virginia, USA. The studied streams drain watersheds with areas of between 2 and 122 km2 during peri- ods when the diurnal stream temperature ranged between 2 and 58C. The method has the advantage of estimating the mean groundwater residence time of discharge from the watershed to the stream without the need for the collection of groundwater infiltrating to streambeds or local groundwater sampled from shallow observation wells near the stream.},

On the basis of an interpretation of this history, the paper then speculates about what kind of future is in store for hydrol- ogy and how we can better prepare for it. The historical narrative underpinning this analysis indicates that progress in hydrological understanding is brought about by changing societal needs and technological opportunities: new ideas are generated by hydrologists through addressing societal needs with the technol- ogies of their time. We suggest that progress in hydrological understanding over the last century has expressed itself through repeated cycles of euphoria and disenchantment, which have served as stimuli for the progress. The progress, for it to happen, also needed inspirational leaders as well as a supportive scien- tific community that provided the backdrop to major advances in the field. The paper concludes that, in a similar way to how Newton, Darwin, and Wegener conducted their research, hydrology too can benefit from synthesis activities aimed at "connecting the dots."},

abstract = {Manmade reservoirs are important components of the terrestrial water balance. Thus, considering the hydro-climatic effects of reservoirs is important in water cycle studies at a river basin to global scales; yet, reservoirs are represented poorly in large-scale hydrological and climate models. Here we present a high-resolution (5 km) continental-scale reservoir storage dynamics and release scheme by enhancing existing schemes and adding critical novel parameterizations to improve reservoir storage and release simulations. The new scheme simulates river-floodplain-reservoir storages in an integrated manner considering their spatial and temporal variations. A new calibration scheme is also incorporated to better simulate reservoir dynamics considering cascade-reservoir effects. Further, since no reservoir bathymetry data are available over large domains, we use a state-of-the-art digital elevation model and reservoir extent data to derive reservoir bed elevation. The new scheme is integrated within the river-floodplain routing scheme of a continental hydrological model LEAF-Hydro-Flood. Results from the simulation of {\~{}}1,900 reservoirs within the contiguous United States suggest that the model well captures the observed reservoir storage-release dynamics. Comparison of our results with those from the existing schemes suggest a significant improvement; importantly, the new scheme reduces the excessive and frequent reservoir overfilling and underfilling. Comparison of results with satellite-based surface water data shows that the model accurately reproduces the large-scale patterns of reservoir-floodplain inundation extents. It is expected that the results of this study will inform the incorporation of reservoirs in hyper-resolution models to improve simulations of terrestrial water storage and flow and examine reservoir-atmosphere interactions over large domains.},

abstract = {Water resources are essential to the ecosystem and social economy in the desert and oasis of the arid Tarim River basin, northwestern China, and expected to be vulnerable to climate change. It has been demonstrated that regional climate models (RCMs) provide more reliable results for a regional impact study of climate change (e.g., on water resources) than general circulation models (GCMs). However, due to their considerable bias it is still necessary to apply bias correction before they are used for water resources research. In this paper, after a sensitivity analysis on input meteorological variables based on the Sobol' method, we compared five precipitation correction methods and three temperature correction methods in downscaling RCM simulations applied over the Kaidu River basin, one of the headwaters of the Tarim River basin. Precipitation correction methods applied include linear scaling (LS), local intensity scaling (LOCI), power transformation (PT), distribution mapping (DM) and quantile mapping (QM), while temperature correction methods are LS, variance scaling (VARI) and DM. The corrected precipitation and temperature were compared to the observed meteorological data, prior to being used as meteorological inputs of a distributed hydrologic model to study their impacts on streamflow. The results show (1) streamflows are sensitive to precipitation, temperature and solar radiation but not to relative humidity and wind speed; (2) raw RCM simulations are heavily biased from observed meteorological data, and its use for streamflow simulations results in large biases from observed streamflow, and all bias correction methods effectively improved these simulations; (3) for precipitation, PT and QM methods performed equally best in correcting the frequency-based indices (e.g., standard deviation, percentile values) while the LOCI method performed best in terms of the time-series-based indices (e.g., Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient, {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}/i{\textgreater}2); (4) for temperature, all correction methods performed equally well in correcting raw temperature; and (5) for simulated streamflow, precipitation correction methods have more significant influence than temperature correction methods and the performances of streamflow simulations are consistent with those of corrected precipitation; i.e., the PT and QM methods performed equally best in correcting flow duration curve and peak flow while the LOCI method performed best in terms of the time-series-based indices. The case study is for an arid area in China based on a specific RCM and hydrologic model, but the methodology and some results can be applied to other areas and models.},

The soil moisture content at various depths was well simulated for six sites in the catchment representing different soil types and landscape positions. The spatial patterns of the soil moisture content appear to be controlled mainly by the soil types, and the results indicated that there is little lateral movement of water in the catchment. Average groundwater recharge was found to be 5{\%} of the annual rainfall, and its spatial patterns were dominated by the soil types.

abstract = {Verification of weather forecasts has been a controversial subject for more than a half century. There are a number of reasons why this problem has been so perplexing to meteorologists and others but one of the most important difficulties seems to be in reaching an agreement on the specification of a scale of goodness for weather forecasts. Numerous systems have been proposed but one of the greatest arguments raised against forecast verification is that forecasts which may be the “best” according to the accepted system of arbitrary scores may not be the most useful forecasts. In attempting to resolve this difficulty the forecaster may often find himself in the position of choosing to ignore the verification system or to let it, do the forecasting for him by “hedging” or “playing the system.” This may lead the forecaster to forecast something other than what he thinks will occur, for it is often easier to analyze the effect of different possible forecasts on the verification score than it is to analyze the weather situation. It is generally agreed that this state of affairs is unsatisfactory, as one essential criterion for satisfactory verification is that the verification scheme should influence the forecaster in no undesirable way. Unfortunately, the criterion is difficult, if not impossible to satisfy, although some schemes will be much worse than others in this respect.
It is the purpose of this paper to discuss one situation where it appears to be possible to devise a verification scheme that cannot influence the forecaster in any undesirable way. This is the case when forecasts are expressed in terms of probability statements. The advantages of expressing the degree of assumed reliability of a forecast numerically have been discussed previously [1, 2, 3, 4] so that the purpose here will not be to emphasize the enhanced usefulness of such forecasts but rather to point out how some aspects of the verification problem are simplified or solved.},

In this paper we argue that the concepts of Entropy and Information provide a seamless and powerful framework for analysis, knowledge generation, model-building, prediction and decision support in the Earth Sciences. In this regard, these concepts explicitly acknowledge the uncertainty intrinsic to Earth Science problems, and allow integration of information from direct observation, theoretical reasoning and physical principles. We start by demonstrating how the use and interpretation of Entropy and Information coincide in Information Theory, Statistical Thermodynamics and Analytical Mechanics, and how this can be taken advantage of when addressing Earth Science problems in general and hydrological problems in particular. In the second part we discuss how Information Physics provides ways to quantify Information and Entropy from fundamental physical principles. This extends their use to cases where the preconditions to calculate Entropy in the classical manner as an aggregate statistical measure are not met. In the Earth Sciences these preconditions are indeed rarely met, either due to limited observations or far from equilibrium evolving systems, hence Information Physics offers new opportunities for improving the treatment of Earth Science problems.},

Here, we explore the spectrum of cur- rent practice in hypothesis formulation and testing in hydrology, based on a random sample of recent research papers. This analysis suggests that in hydrology, as in other fields, hypothesis formulation and testing rarely corre- spond to the idealized model of the scientificmethod. Practicessuchas‘‘p-hacking'' or ‘‘HARKing''(Hypothesizing After the Results are Known) aremajor obstacles tomore rigorous hypothesis testing in hydrology, along with the well-known problem of confirmation bias—the tendency to value and trust confirmations more than refuta- tions—among both researchers and reviewers. Nonetheless, as several examples illustrate, hypothesis tests have played an essential role in spurringmajor advances in hydrological theory. Hypothesis testing is not the only recipe for scientific progress, however. Exploratory research, driven by innovations in measurement and observation, has also underlainmany key advances. Further improvements in observation and measurementwill be vital to both exploratory research and hypothesis testing, and thus to advancing the science of hydrology.},

abstract = {ERA5 (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis Fifth Generation) is a significant dataset in climate reanalysis. Conducting a global-scale accuracy assessment and spatiotemporal distribution characteristic study of its temperature and precipitation data is crucial for gaining in-depth understanding of extreme climate changes. This study, based on CRU TS v4.04 (Climatic Research Unit Time-Series version 4.04) gridded data, employs multiple statistical indicators and detection metrics to assess the accuracy of the ERA5 temperature and precipitation dataset at a monthly scale over the past 70 years. Additionally, it utilizes Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) to explore its spatiotemporal distribution characteristics. The results indicate that: (1) ERA5 demonstrates good consistency in most regions globally; however, the influence of uneven station density distribution results in weaker correlation in areas with sparse station density. (2) The accuracy of ERA5 data exhibits certain differences between the two periods (1950–1979, 1979–2019); with the overall performance of ERA5 temperature data near the Earth's surface being better than that of precipitation data. (3) ERA5 precipitation data in the mid and low latitudes of the Southern and Northern Hemispheres exhibit characteristics of positive–negative distribution, while temperature data show an opposite distribution in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres (with a predominant pattern of warmer temperatures in the north and colder temperatures in the south). Additionally, the typical patterns for both variables occur in January and July each year. The above study will provide reference and insights for future climate change prediction and adaptation efforts.},

abstract = {This paper presents a discussion of the predictive capacity of the implementation of the semi-distributed hydrological modeling system JGrass-NewAge. This model focuses on the hydrological budgets of medium scale to large scale basins as the product of the processes at the hillslope scale with the interplay of the river network. The part of the modeling system presented here deals with the: (i) estimation of the space-time structure of precipitation, (ii) estimation of runoff production; (iii) aggregation and propagation of flows in channel; (v) estimation of evapotranspiration; (vi) automatic calibration of the discharge with the method of particle swarming. The system is based on a hillslope-link geometrical partition of the landscape, combining raster and vectorial treatment of hillslope data with vector based tracking of flow in channels. Measured precipitation are spatially interpolated with the use of kriging. Runoff production at each channel link is estimated through a peculiar application of the Hymod model. Routing in channels uses an integrated flow equation and produces discharges at any link end, for any link in the river network. Evapotranspiration is estimated with an implementation of the Priestley-Taylor equation. The model system assembly is calibrated using the particle swarming algorithm. A two year simulation of hourly discharge of the Little Washita (OK, USA) basin is presented and discussed with the support of some classical indices of goodness of fit, and analysis of the residuals. A novelty with respect to traditional hydrological modeling is that each of the elements above, including the preprocessing and the analysis tools, is implemented as a software component, built upon Object Modelling System v3 and jgrasstools prescriptions, that can be cleanly switched in and out at run-time, rather than at compiling time. The possibility of creating different modeling products by the connection of modules with or without the calibration tool, as for instance the case of the present modeling chain, reduces redundancy in programming, promotes collaborative work, enhances the productivity of researchers, and facilitates the search for the optimal modeling solution. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2011.},

abstract = {Assessment of water resources available in different storages and moving along different pathways in a catchment is important for its optimal use and protection, and also for the prediction of floods and low flows. Moreover, understanding of the runoff generation processes is essential for assessing the impacts of climate and land use changes on the hydro logical response of a catchment. Many methods for base flow separation exist, but hardly one focuses on the specific behaviour of temperate lowland areas. This paper presents the results of a base flow separation study carried out in a lowland area in the Netherlands. In this study, field observations of precipitation, groundwater and surface water levels and discharges, together with tracer analysis are used to understand the runoff generation processes in the catchment. Several tracer and non-tracer based base flow separation methods were applied to the discharge time series, and their results are compared. The results show that groundwater levels react fast to precipitation events in this lowland area with shallow groundwater tables. Moreover, a good correlation was found between groundwater levels and discharges suggesting that most of the measured discharge also during floods comes from groundwater storage. It was estimated using tracer hydro logical approaches that approximately 90{\%} of the total discharge is groundwater displaced by event water mainly infiltrating in the northern part of the catchment, and only the remaining 10{\%} is surface runoff. The impact of remote recharge causing displacement of near channel ground water during floods could also be motivated with hydraulic approximations. The results show further that when base flow separation is meant to identify groundwater contributions to stream flow, process based methods (e.g. the rating curve method; Kliner and Knezek, 1974) are more reliable than other simple non-tracer based methods. Also, the recursive filtering method (proposed by Eckhardt, 2005) can be calibrated well using the results of tracer investigation giving good results. Consequently, non-tracer based base flow separation methods that can be validated for some events may provide a powerful tool for groundwater assessment or model calibration/validation in lowland areas. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2009.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Hydrology has undergone almost transformative changes over the past 50 years. Huge strides have been made in the transition from early empirical approaches to rigorous approaches based on the fluid mechanics of water movement on and below the land surface. However, progress has been hampered by problems posed by the presence of heterogeneity, including subsurface heterogeneity present at all scales. The inability to measure or map the heterogeneity everywhere prevented the development of balance equations and associated closure relations at the scales of interest, and has led to the virtual impasse we are presently in, in terms of development of physically based models needed for hydrologic predictions. An alternative to the mapping of heterogeneity everywhere is a new Earth system science view, which sees the heterogeneity as the end result of co-evolutionary hydrological, geomorphological, ecological, and pedological processes, each operating at a different rate, which help to shape the landscapes that we find in nature, including the heterogeneity that we do not readily see. The expectation is that instead of specifying exact details of the heterogeneity in our models, we can replace it (without loss of information) with the ecosystem function that they perform. Guided by this new Earth system science perspective, development of hydrologic science is now addressing new questions using novel holistic co-evolutionary approaches as opposed to the physical, fluid mechanics based reductionist approaches that we inherited from the recent past. In the emergent Anthropocene, the co-evolutionary view has expanded further to involve interactions and feedbacks with human-social processes as well. In this paper, I present my own perspective of key milestones in the transformation of hydrologic science from engineering hydrology to Earth system science, drawn from the work of several students and colleagues of mine, and discuss their implication for hydrologic observations, theory development, and predictions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Despite the recognized importance of reservoirs and dams, global datasets describing their characteristics and geographical distribution are largely incomplete. To enable advanced assessments of the role and effects of dams within the global river network and to support strategies for mitigating ecohydrological and socioeconomic costs, we introduce here the spatially explicit and hydrologically linked Global Reservoir and Dam database (GRanD). As of early 2011, GRanD contains information regarding 6862 dams and their associated reservoirs, with a total storage capacity of 6197 km 3. On the basis of these records, we estimate that about 16.7 million reservoirs larger than 0.01 ha - with a combined storage capacity of approximately 8070 km 3 - may exist worldwide, increasing Earth's terrestrial surface water area by more than 305 000 km 2. We find that 575 900 river kilometers, or 7.6{\%} of the world's rivers with average flows above 1 cubic meter per second (m 3 s -1), are affected by a cumulative upstream reservoir capacity that exceeds 2{\%} of their annual flow; the impact is highest for large rivers with average flows above 1000 m 3 s -1, of which 46.7{\%} are affected. Finally, a sensitivity analysis suggests that smaller reservoirs have substantial impacts on the spatial extent of flow alterations despite their minor role in total reservoir capacity. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {The aim of this work is to deepen our understanding on the mutual relationship between climate, vegetation and soil water budget within an ecohydrological framework. To this end a coupled hydrological/ecological model is adopted to describe simultaneously soil water budget and vegetation pattern evolution in a semiarid river basin in New Mexico (USA). This basin represents an ideal area to study the properties of water-controlled ecosystems. Analyses have been carried out using a recently formulated framework for the water balance at the daily level linked with a vegetation model for the description of the spatial organization of vegetation. Using this approach, we identified the dynamic water stress of vegetation during the growing season, taking into account effects of morphology on the spatial distribution of solar radiation and the initial soil moisture condition at the beginning of the growing season. Several different variants of the vegetation model have been tested with the aim to identify the main drivers for the spatial organization of the vegetation. Results clearly show that the observed vegetation patterns emerge from the minimization of water stress and the maximization of water use.},

abstract = {Despite improvements in forecasting extreme weather events, noncompliance with weather warnings among the public remains a problem. Although there are likely many reasons for noncompliance with weather warnings, one important factor might be people's past experiences with false alarms. The research presented here explores the role of false alarms in weather-related decision making. Over a series of trials, participants used an overnight low temperature forecast and advice from a decision aid to decide whether to apply salt treatment to a town's roads to prevent icy conditions or take the risk of withholding treatment, which resulted in a large penalty when freezing temperatures occurred. The decision aid gave treatment recommendations, some of which were false alarms, i.e., treatment was recommended but observed temperatures were above freezing. The rate at which the advice resulted in false alarms was manipulated between groups. Results suggest that very high and very low false alarm rates led to inferior decision making, but that lowering the false alarm rate slightly did not significantly affect compliance or decision quality. However, adding a probabilistic uncertainty estimate in the forecasts improved both compliance and decision quality. These findings carry implications about how weather warnings should be communicated to the public.},

abstract = {A series of numerical experiments has been designed to investigate how effective satellite estimates of radiometric surface temperatures and soil surface moisture are for calibrating a Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) model. Multi-objective calibration based on error minimization of temperature and soil moisture model outputs is performed in a semi-arid environment. Model accuracy when calibrated using in situ versus satellite objectives is explored in detail. Observational meteorological datasets from the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) were used to force a column model during a growing season in Mali. Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST) revealed the most sensitive parameters to model outputs. Parameters found sensitive were subsequently optimized in a series of model calibrations to reveal trade-offs between model objectives. Our main findings are (1) the SVAT model performs well in the semi-arid environment, but underestimates peak growing season evapotranspiration and overestimates soil moisture, (2) most of the parameters important for flux estimates can be constrained using surface temperature and soil surface moisture with the three exceptions: root depth, the extinction coefficient and unstressed stomatal resistance, (3) flux simulations are improved when the model is calibrated using in situ surface temperature and soil surface moisture versus satellite estimates. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Abstract. A multivariate analysis on flood variables is needed to design some hydraulic structures like dams, as the complexity of the routing process in a reservoir requires a representation of the full hydrograph. In this work, a bivariate copula model was used to obtain the bivariate joint distribution of flood peak and volume, in order to know the probability of occurrence of a given inflow hydrograph. However, the risk of dam overtopping is given by the maximum water elevation reached during the routing process, which depends on the hydrograph variables, the reservoir volume and the spillway crest length. Consequently, an additional bivariate return period, the so-called routed return period, was defined in terms of risk of dam overtopping based on this maximum water elevation obtained after routing the inflow hydrographs. The theoretical return periods, which give the probability of occurrence of a hydrograph prior to accounting for the reservoir routing, were compared with the routed return period, as in both cases hydrographs with the same probability will draw a curve in the peak-volume space. The procedure was applied to the case study of the Santillana reservoir in Spain. Different reservoir volumes and spillway lengths were considered to investigate the influence of the dam and reservoir characteristics on the results. The methodology improves the estimation of the Design Flood Hydrograph and can be applied to assess the risk of dam overtopping.},

abstract = {A consistent framework for parameter estimation in distributed hydrological catchment modelling using automatic calibration is formulated. The framework focuses on the different steps in the estimation process from model parameterisation and selection of calibration parameters, formulation of calibration criteria, and choice of optimisation algorithm. The calibration problem is formulated in a general multi-objective context in which different objective functions that measure individual process descriptions can be optimised simultaneously. Within this framework it is possible to tailor the model calibration to the specific objectives of the model application being considered. A test example is presented that illustrates the use of the calibration framework for parameter estimation in the MIKE SHE integrated and distributed hydrological modelling system. A significant trade-off between the performance of the groundwater level simulations and the catchment runoff is observed in this case, defining a Pareto front with a very sharp structure. The Pareto optimum solution corresponding to a proposed balanced aggregated objective function is seen to provide a proper balance between the two objectives. Compared to a manual expert calibration, the balanced Pareto optimum solution provides generally better simulation of the runoff, whereas virtually similar performance is obtained for the groundwater level simulations.

abstract = {Flow prediction in ungauged catchments is a major unresolved challenge in scientific and engineering hydrology. This study attacks the prediction in ungauged catchment problem by exploiting advances in flow index selection and regionalization in Bayesian inference and by developing new statistical tests of model performance in ungauged catchments. First, an extensive set of available flow indices is reduced using principal component (PC) analysis to a compact orthogonal set of “flow index PCs.” These flow index PCs are regionalized under minimal assumptions using random forests regression augmented with a residual error model and used to condition hydrological model parameters using a Bayesian scheme. Second, “adequacy” tests are proposed to evaluate a priori the hydrological and regionalization model performance in the space of flow index PCs. The proposed regionalization approach is applied to 92 northern Spain catchments, with 16 catchments treated as ungauged. It is shown that (1) a small number of PCs capture approximately 87{\%} of variability in the flow indices and (2) adequacy tests with respect to regionalized information are indicative of (but do not guarantee) the ability of a hydrological model to predict flow time series and are hence proposed as a prerequisite for flow prediction in ungauged catchments. The adequacy tests identify the regionalization of flow index PCs as adequate in 12 of 16 catchments but the hydrological model as adequate in only 1 of 16 catchments. Hence, a focus on improving hydrological model structure and input data (the effects of which are not disaggregated in this work) is recommended.},

@article{Baratgin2024,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract. Climate change and evolving water management practices may have a significant impact on hydropower generation. While hydrological models have been widely used to assess these effects, they often present some limitations. A major challenge lies in modeling the release decisions for hydropower reservoirs, which result from intricate trade-offs, involving power sector dispatch, competing water uses, and the spatial allocation of power generation within the grid. To address this gap, this study introduces a novel demand-based approach for integrating hydropower within the routing module of land surface models. First, hydropower infrastructures are located in coherence with the hydrological network, and links are built between hydropower plants and their supplying reservoirs to explicitly represent water transfers built for hydropower generation. Then, coordinated dam operation is simulated by distributing a prescribed electric demand to be satisfied by hydropower across the different power plants within the power grid, while considering the operational constraints associated with the multipurpose nature of most dams. To validate this approach, we implement the framework within the water transport scheme of a land surface model and assess it with the case study of the French electrical system. We drive the model with a high-resolution atmospheric reanalysis and prescribe the observed national hydropower production as the total power demand to be met by hydropower infrastructures. By comparing the simulated evolution of reservoir stocks to observations, we find that the model simulates realistic operations of reservoirs and successfully satisfies hydropower production demands over the entire period. We also highlight the roles of uncertainties in estimated precipitation and of the limited knowledge of hydropower infrastructure in the estimation of production. Finally, we show that such an integration of hydropower operations in the model improves the simulations of river discharges in mountainous catchments affected by hydropower.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Since the 1950s, Europe has seen large shifts in climate and land cover. Previous assessments of past and future changes in evapotranspiration or streamflow have either focussed on land use/cover or climate contributions, or have focussed on individual catchments under specific climate conditions. Here, we aim to understand how decadal changes in climate (e.g., precipitation, temperature) and land use (e.g., de-/afforestation, urbanization) have impacted the amount and distribution of water resources availability across Europe since the 1950s. To this end, we simulate the distribution of green and blue water fluxes at high-resolution (1{\&}thinsp;{\&}times;{\&}thinsp;1{\&}thinsp;km) by combining (a) a steady-state Budyko model for water balance partitioning constrained by long-term (lysimeter) observations across different land-use types, (b) a novel decadal high-resolution historical land use reconstruction, and (c) gridded observations of key meteorological variables. The continental-scale patterns in the simulations agree well with coarser-scale observation-based estimates of evapotranspiration, and also with observed changes in streamflow from small basins across Europe. We find that strong shifts in the continental-scale patterns of evapotranspiration and streamflow have occured from 1950 to 2010. In Sweden, for example, increased precipitation dominates effects of large scale re- and afforestation leading to increases in both streamflow and evapotranspiration. In most of the Mediterrenean, decreased precipitation combines with increased forest cover and potential evapotranspiration to reduce streamflow. In spite of local and regional scale complexity, the Europe-wide net contribution of land use, precipitation and potential evapotranspiration changes to changes in ET is similar with around {\~{}}{\&}thinsp;40{\&}thinsp;km3/y, equivalent to the discharge of a large river. For streamflow, changes in precipitation dominate land use and potential evapotranspiration contributions with {\~{}}{\&}thinsp;90{\&}thinsp;km3/y compared to {\~{}}{\&}thinsp;45{\&}thinsp;km3/y. Locally, increased forest cover and urbanisation have lead to significant decreases and increases of available streamflow.},

abstract = {This report documents methods and guidelines for model calibration using inverse model- ing. The inverse modeling and statistical methods discussed are broadly applicable, but are present- ed as implemented in the computer programs UCODE, a universal inverse code that can be used with any application model, and MODFLOWP, an inverse code limited to one application model. UCODE and MODFLOWP perform inverse modeling, posed as a parameter-estimation problem, by calculating parameter values that minimize a weighted least-squares objective function using nonlinear regression. Minimization is accomplished using a modified Gauss-Newton method, and prior, or direct, information on estimated parameters can be included in the regression. Inverse modeling in many fields is plagued by problems of instability and nonuniqueness, and obtaining useful results depends on (1) defining a tractable inverse problem using simplifications appropriate to the system under investigation and (2) wise use of statistics generated using calculated sensitiv- ities and the match between observed and simulated values, and associated graphical analyses. Fourteen guidelines presented in this work suggest ways of constructing and calibrating models of complex systems such that the resulting model is as accurate and useful as possible.},

abstract = {Many hydrological models including root water uptake (RWU) do not consider the dimension of root system hydraulic architecture (HA) because explicitly solving water flow in such a complex system is too time consuming. However, they might lack process understanding when basing RWU and plant water stress predictions on functions of variables such as the root length density distribution. On the basis of analytical solutions of water flow in a simple HA, we developed an "implicit" model of the root system HA for simulation of RWU distribution (sink term of Richards' equation) and plant water stress in three-dimensional soil water flow models. The new model has three macroscopic parameters defined at the soil element scale, or at the plant scale, rather than for each segment of the root system architecture: the standard sink fraction distribution SSF, the root system equivalent conductance Krs and the compensatory RWU conductance Kcomp. It clearly decouples the process of water stress from compensatory RWU, and its structure is appropriate for hydraulic lift simulation. As compared to a model explicitly solving water flow in a realistic maize root system HA, the implicit model showed to be accurate for predicting RWU distribution and plant collar water potential, with one single set of parameters, in dissimilar water dynamics scenarios. For these scenarios, the computing time of the implicit model was a factor 28 to 214 shorter than that of the explicit one. We also provide a new expression for the effective soil water potential sensed by plants in soils with a heterogeneous water potential distribution, which emerged from the implicit model equations. With the proposed implicit model of the root system HA, new concepts are brought which open avenues towards simple and mechanistic RWU models and water stress functions operational for field scale water dynamics simulation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Author(s).

M{\'{e}}todos
Comprobar tres suposiciones del modelo:
1) Las ecucaciones desarrolladas para un sistema sencillo son aplicables a sistemas m{\'{a}}s complejos.
2) La resistencia axial de las ra{\'{i}}ces es suficientemente peque{\~{n}}a para obviar su efecto en la compensaci{\'{o}}n del RWU.
3) El potencial suelo-ra{\'{i}}z de todos los nodos de ra{\'{i}}z dentro de un elemento de suelo es igual a la media del potencial en los nodos de dicho elemento suelo.

Test instant{\'{a}}neos para comprobar la existencia de par{\'{a}}metros macrosc{\'{o}}picos. Test a largo plazo para cuantificar la precisi{\'{o}}n del modelo.

Resultados
- La tasa de RWU es la suma de dos procesos: el RWU standard, con potencial del suelo uniforme, y el RWU de compensaci{\'{o}}n, que tiene en cuenta redistribuciones por variaciones en el potencial del suelo (redistribuci{\'{o}}n hidr{\'{a}}ulica).
- El estr{\'{e}}s h{\'{i}}drico se determina {\'{u}}nicamente por el potencial hidr{\'{a}}ulico en la base de la planta.
- El modelo tiene tres par{\'{a}}metros macrosc{\'{o}}picos: la fracci{\'{o}}n de sumidero est{\'{a}}ndard, dependiente del sitema radicular y sus propiedades hidr{\'{a}}ulicas, la conductancia equivalente del sistema radicular, importante en el c{\'{a}}lculo del estr{\'{e}}s h{\'{i}}drico, y la conductancia del RWU de compensaci{\'{o}}n.
- Alta precisi{\'{o}}n del modelo en comparaci{\'{o}}n con un modelo expl{\'{i}}cito (Doussan). La precisi{\'{o}}n se ve severamente afectada si no se tiene en cuenca la compensaci{\'{o}}n.

Recently, a global optimization method known as the SCE-UA (shuffled complex evolution method developed at The Uni- versity of Arizona) has shown promise as an effective and efficient optimization technique for calibrating watershed models. Experience with the method has indicated that the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm are influenced by the choice of the algorithmic parameters. This paper first reviews the essential concepts of the SCE-UA method and then presents the results of several experimental studies in which the National Weather Service river forecast system- soil moisture accounting (NWSRFS-SMA) model, used by the National Weather Service for river and flood forecasting, was calibrated using different algorithmic parameter setups. On the basis of these results, the recommended values for the algorithmic parameters are given. These values should also help to provide guidelines for other users of the SCE-UA method.},

abstract = {The Mississippi Delta, a portion of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain (MAP) located in northwest Mississippi (USA), is an area dense with industrial-level agriculture sustained by groundwater-dependent irrigation supplied by the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer. Observed declines in groundwater-level elevations and streamflow, contemporaneous with increases in irrigation, have raised concerns about future groundwater availability and the effects of groundwater withdrawals on streamflow. To quantify the impacts of groundwater withdrawals on streamflow and increase understanding of groundwater and surface-water interaction in the MAP, hydrograph-separation techniques were used to estimate baseflow and identify statistical streamflow trends. The analysis was conducted using the US Geological Survey Groundwater Toolbox open-source software and daily hydrologic data provided by a spatially distributed network of paired groundwater wells and streamgage sites. This study found that statistically significant reductions in stream baseflow occurred in areas with substantial groundwater-level declines. The use of hydrograph-separation and trend analyses to quantify the impacts of groundwater withdrawals and the use of streamflow as a proxy for changes in groundwater availability may be applicable in other altered environments. Characterizing and defining hydrologic relations between groundwater and surface water will help scientists and water-resource managers refine a regional groundwater-flow model that includes the Mississippi Delta, which will be used to aid water-resource managers in future decisions concerning the alluvial aquifer.},

abstract = {Mountain ecosystems will likely be affected by global warming during the 21st century, with substantial biodiversity loss predicted by species distribution models (SDMs). Depending on the geographic extent, elevation range, and spatial resolution of data used in making these models, different rates of habitat loss have been predicted, with associated risk of species extinction. Few coordinated across-scale comparisons have been made using data of different resolutions and geographic extents. Here, we assess whether climate change-induced habitat losses predicted at the European scale (10 × 10' grid cells) are also predicted from local-scale data and modeling (25 m × 25 m grid cells) in two regions of the Swiss Alps. We show that local-scale models predict persistence of suitable habitats in up to 100{\%} of species that were predicted by a European-scale model to lose all their suitable habitats in the area. Proportion of habitat loss depends on climate change scenario and study area. We find good agreement between the mismatch in predictions between scales and the fine-grain elevation range within 10 × 10' cells. The greatest prediction discrepancy for alpine species occurs in the area with the largest nival zone. Our results suggest elevation range as the main driver for the observed prediction discrepancies. Local-scale projections may better reflect the possibility for species to track their climatic requirement toward higher elevations.},

A sediment model was calibrated and validated under three different initial sediment conditions: (0) no sediment availability, (1) calibration of the initial sediment condition and (2) using a warm-up simulation. The model results were assessed in terms of the graphic of fine sediment transport, or sedigraphs, and the visual fit of the hysteresis on the sediment rating.All strategies provided adequate results. However, the loop rating curve analysis demonstrated that the choice of initial sediment conditions affected the simulation results. Without any initial sediment condition, the model results were typically inferior to the simulation results with calibration or warm-up. The calibration of initial conditions proved to be the most reliable technique to generate clockwise hysteresis loops, but failed in reproducing other loop types. Overall, the warm-up simulations showed encouraging results, providing satisfactory fine sedigraph simulation results. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The soil moisture dynamics under seasonally fixed conditions are studied at a point. The water balance is described through the representation of rainfall as a marked Poisson process, which in turn produces an infiltration into the soil dependent on the existing level of soil moisture. The losses from the soil are due to evapotranspiration and leakage, which are also considered dependent on the existing soil moisture. The steady-state probability distributions for soil moisture are then analytically obtained. The analysis of the distribution allows for the assessment of the role of climate, soil and vegetation on soil moisture dynamics. Further hydrologic insight is obtained by studying the various components of an average water balance. The realistic representation of the processes acting at a site and the analytical tractability of the model make it well suited for further analyses that consider the spatial aspect of soil moisture dynamics.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Soil Science Society of America. The spatiotemporal distribution of root water uptake (RWU) depends on the dynamics of the root distribution and compensatory uptake from wetter regions in the root zone. This work aimed to parameterize three RWU models with different representations of compensation: the Feddes–Jarvis model that uses an empirical function, the Feddes model without compensation, and the Couvreur model that is based on a physical description of water flow in the soil–root system. These models were implemented in HYDRUS-1D, and soil hydraulic parameters were optimized by inverse modeling using soil water content and potential measurements and observations of root distributions of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in horizontally installed rhizotubes. Soil moisture was equally well predicted by the three models, and the soil hydraulic parameters optimized by the models with compensation were comparable. The obtained RWU parameters of the Feddes–Jarvis model were consistent with data reported in the literature, although the pressure heads h 3l and h 3h for lower and higher transpirations rates, respectively, could not be uniquely identified. Response surfaces of the objective function showed that the root-related parameters of the Couvreur model could be identified using inverse modeling. Furthermore, these parameters were consistent with combined root architectural and hydraulic observations from the literature. The Feddes–Jarvis and Couvreur models simulated similar root-system-scale stress functions that link total RWU to the effective root zone water potential, suggesting that parameters may be transferable between the two models. Simulated RWU profiles differed due to different water redistribution by the root system, but the measurements were not sufficiently precise to observe this redistribution.},

abstract = {A method to regionalize model parameters using self-organizing maps (SOM) has been developed from that presented by Wallner, Haberlandt {\&} Dietrich (2013).The novelty of this method is that the SOM is divided in four partitions, each one belonging to one of the routines of the hydrological model HBV-IWW. Every partition receives a specific input space composed of its most representative catchment descriptors. Three data mining techniques were applied to find those descriptors: multiple linear regressions, SOM, and random forest. The study used data from 178 mesoscale catchments in Lower Saxony (northern Germany). A pool of 65 catchment descriptors were derived and analysed. After the regionalization of the model parameters, daily flows were simulated using the model HBV-IWW and climatic time series and compared with discharge records. The selection of descriptors for each routine found interesting relationships, especially for the soil routine. The application of this knowledge reduced the variability of the optimized model parameters, meaning that the problem of equifinality was constrained. However, the better optimization of the model parameters did not improve the simulation of daily flows.},

In that sense, this study aims to contribute to a better understanding and modelling of the hydrological and biogeochemical (carbon and nitrogen) cycles and their interactions in semiarid conditions and to test the capability of a new parsimonious model to satisfactorily reproduce them. The proposed model (TETIS-CN) and two additional widely used models were implemented in a Quercus ilex forest, and no noteworthy differences were found. Results suggest that: (1) it is important to include carbon observations in the calibration process and to consider all the existing vegetation species in the simulation; (2) a fixed daily potential uptake may not be appropriate to reproduce plant nitrogen uptake; and (3) TETIS-CN, with a lower number of parameters, proved an acceptable tool.},

abstract = {Multivariate calibration using measurements of multiple water balance components has emerged as a potential solution for improving the performance and realism of large scale hydrologic models. In this study we develop a novel multivariate calibration framework to rigorously test whether incorporation of multiple water balance components into calibration can result in sufficiently accurate (behavioral) solutions for all model responses. Unlike previous studies, we use Bayesian calibration to formally define limits of acceptability or error thresholds in order to distinguish behavioral solutions for each of the incorporated fluxes. We apply the framework in the Mississippi river basin for the calibration of a large scale distributed hydrologic model (Noah-MP) with different combinations of model responses - evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture (SM), and streamflow (SF). The results of the study show that incorporation of additional fluxes and soil moisture (a storage variable) is not always valuable due to significant trade-offs in accuracy among the model responses. In our experiments, only ET and SF could be simulated simultaneously to a reasonable degree of accuracy. In addition, we quantify the trade-offs in accuracy between the model responses using the concept of Pareto optimality. We find that combining ET with other fluxes entails higher trade-offs in accuracy compared to either SM or SF. Unlike deterministic calibration, with the developed framework we are able to identify deficiencies in model parameterization that lead to significant trade-offs in accuracy, especially between ET and SM. We find that the parameters which are insensitive to individual model responses can influence the trade-off relationship between them.},

abstract = {A decadal-scale study to retrieve the spatio-temporal precipitation patterns of the Yangtze River basin, China, using the Tropical Rain Mapping Mission, Precipitation Radar (TRMM/PR) data is presented. The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) based on monthly TRMM/PR data extracts several leading precipitation patterns, which are largely connected with physical implications at the basin scale. With the aid of gauge station data, the amplitudes of major principal components (PCs) were used to examine the generic relationships between precipitation variations and hydrological extremes (e.g. floods and droughts) during summer seasons over the past decade. The emergence of such major precipitation patterns clearly reveals the possible linkages with hydrological processes, and the oscillations in relation to the amplitude of major PCs are consistent with these observed hydrological extremes. Although the floods in some sections of the Yangtze River were, to some extent, tied to human activities, such as the removal of wetlands, the variations in major precipitation patterns are recognized as the primary driving force of the flow extremes associated with floods and droughts. The research findings indicate that long-distance hydro-meteorological signals of large-scale precipitation variations over such a large river basin can be successfully identified with the aid of EOF analysis. The retrieved precipitation patterns and their low-frequency jumps of amplitude in relation to PCs are valuable tools to help understand the association between the precipitation variations and the occurrence of hydrological extremes. Such a study can certainly aid in disaster mitigation and decision-making in water resource management.Editor Z.W. Kundzewicz; Associate editor A.

This paper analyzes the relation between the variation of the upper soil hydraulic properties due to changes in land use and its effect on the magnitude of peak flows: (1) incorporating fractal scaling properties to relate the effect of the static storage capacity (the sum of capillary water storage capacity in the root zone, canopy interception and surface puddles) and the upper soil vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity on the flood regime; (2) describing the effect of the spatial organization of the upper soil hydraulic properties at catchment scale; (3) examining the scale properties in the parameters of the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) probability distribution function, in relation to the upper soil hydraulic properties. This study considered the historical changes of land use in the Combeima River catchment in South America, between 1991 and 2007, using distributed hydrological modeling of daily discharges to describe the hydrological response. Through simulation of land cover scenarios, it was demonstrated that it is possible to quantify the magnitude of peak flows in scenarios of land cover changes through its Wide-Sense Simple Scaling with the upper soil hydraulic properties.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper introduces and presents the Spatial Processes in HYdrology (SPHY) model (v2.0), its development background, its underlying concepts, and some typical applications. The SPHY model is developed using the best components of existing and well-tested simulation models, and is developed with the explicit aim to simulate terrestrial hydrology at flexible scales, under various land use and climate conditions. SPHY is a spatially distributed leaky bucket type of model, and is applied on a cell-by-cell basis. The model is written in the Python programming language using the PCRaster dynamic modelling framework. Compared to other hydrological models, that typically focus on the simulation of streamflow only, the SPHY model has several advantages: it (i) integrates most relevant hydrological processes, (ii) is setup modular, (iii) is easy adjustable and applicable, (iii) can easily be linked to remote sensing data, and (iv) can be applied for operational as well as strategic decision support. The most relevant hydrological processes that are integrated in the SPHY model are rainfall–runoff processes, cryosphere processes, evapotranspiration processes, the simulation of dynamic vegetational cover, lake/reservoir outflow, and the simulation of rootzone moisture contents. Studies in which the SPHY model was successfully applied and tested are described in this paper, and range from (i) real-time soil moisture predictions to support irrigation management in lowland areas, to (ii) detailed climate change impact studies in snow and glacier-fed river basins, to (iii) operational flow forecasting in mountainous catchments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Baseflow estimation and evaluation are two critical and essential tasks for water quality and quantity, drought management, water supply, and groundwater protection. Observed baseflows are rarely available and are limited to focused pilot studies. In this study, an exhaustive evaluation of four different baseflow separation methods (HYSEP, WHAT, BFLOW, and PART) using surrogates of observed baseflows estimated with the conductivity mass balance (CMB) method is carried out using data from several streamflow gauging sites from the South Atlantic-Gulf (SAG) region comprised of nine states in the Southeastern U.S. Daily discharge data from 75 streamflow gauging sites for the period 1970-2013, located in the least anthropogenically affected basins in the SAG region were used to estimate the baseflow index (BFI), which quantifies the contribution of baseflow from streamflows. The focus of this study is to compare the four different baseflow separation methods and calibrate and validate these methods using CMB method based estimates of baseflows to evaluate the variation of BFI values derived from these methods. Results from the study suggest that the PART and HYSEP methods provide the highest and lowest average BFI values of 0.62 and 0.52, respectively. Similarities in BFI values estimated from these methods are noted based on a strong correlation between WHAT and BFLOW. The highest BFI values were found in April in the eastern, western, and central parts of the SAG region, and the highest contribution of baseflow to the streamflow was noted in October in the southern region. However, the lowest BFI values were noted in the month of September in all regions of SAG. The calibrated WHAT method using data from the CMB method provides the highest correlation as noted by the coefficient of determination. This study documents an exhaustive and comprehensive evaluation of baseflow separation methods in the SAG region, and results from this work can aid in the selection of the best method based on different metrics reported in this study. The use of the best method can aid in the short and long term management of low flows at a regional level that supports a sustainable aquatic environment and mitigates the effects of droughts effectively.},

@article{Fowler2018,
abstract = {Abstract It has been widely shown that rainfall?runoff models often provide poor and biased simulations after a change in climate, but evidence suggests existing models may be capable of better simulations if calibration strategies are improved. Common practice is to use ?least squares??type objective functions, which focus on hydrological behavior during high flows. However, simulation of a drying climate may require a more balanced consideration of other parts of the flow regime, including mid?low flows and drier years in the calibration period, as a closer analogue of future conditions. Here we systematically test eight objective functions over 86 catchments and five conceptual model structures in southern and eastern Australia. We focus on performance when evaluated over multiyear droughts. The results show significant improvements are possible compared to least squares calibration. In particular, the Refined Index of Agreement (based on sum of absolute error, not sum of squared error) and a new objective function called the Split KGE (which gives equal weight to each year in the calibration series) give significantly better split?sample results than least squares approaches. This improvement held for all five model structures, regardless of basin characteristics such as slope, vegetation, and across a range of climatic conditions (e.g., mean precipitation between 500 and 1,500 mm/yr). We recommend future studies to avoid least squares approaches (e.g., optimizing NSE or KGE with no prior transformation on streamflow) and adopt these alternative methods, wherever simulations in a drying climate are required.},

@phdthesis{Brown2008,
abstract = {Forests use more water than grass. This statement has implications for how we manage land-use change and water resources. This thesis uses paired catchment studies to understand how alterations in forest cover affect streamflow. This understanding is used to develop a model for predicting how a catchment's flow duration curve (FDC) will change following a change in forest cover. The model has been tested on catchments undergoing a permanent change in forest cover and has proven to be robust. Paired catchment studies have been widely used as a means of determining the magnitude of water yield changes resulting from changes in vegetation. This thesis reviews the use of paired catchment studies for determining the changes in water yield at various time scales resulting from permanent changes in vegetation. Comparisons are made between paired catchment results and a mean annual water balance model and show good agreement between the two methodologies. Four types of paired catchment studies are considered in the thesis and the results highlight the potential underestimation of streamflow changes if regrowth experiments are used to predict the impact of permanent alterations to forest cover. The literature review summarises seasonal changes in water yield, highlights the proportionally larger impact on low flows, and demonstrates the potential for using FDCs to gain a greater understanding of the impact of vegetation on the distribution of daily flows. The literature review highlighted that different methods used to assess the impact of forest cover make general conclusions difficult to draw. A consistent analysis of data from 46 paired catchment studies assessed annual streamflow and FDCs. The results indicate that it takes between 8 and 25 years for a catchment to reach a new equilibrium following a permanent change in forest cover. Analysis of the FDCs in the afforestation and deforestation experiments showed that the responses could be grouped into three categories. These are: (1) catchments that a change from perennial to ephemeral, or ephemeral catchments have a change in the number of zero flow days, (2) perennial catchments that have a proportionally larger reduction in low flows compared to high flow, and, (3) perennial catchments have a uniform reduction in all flow percentiles. The analysis of paired catchment studies demonstrated that FDCs could alter in different ways following a change in forest cover. To develop a predictive methodology for adjusting a catchment's FDC for forest cover change a five-parameter model was developed to describe the shape of any FDC. The model proved to provide good predictions for all flow percentiles. To adjust the shape of the FDC for change in forest cover, the parameters of the FDC model for current vegetation conditions are adjusted based on an estimated change in mean annual streamflow. The linkage between the estimated change in mean annual streamflow and the parameters of the FDC model comes from the knowledge that the area under the FDC must be equal to the mean annual streamflow. The FDC adjustment methodology was tested on 17 experimental catchments that have undergone large percentage changes in forest cover and has proved to be a robust procedure. To demonstrate the applicability of this methodology to real world catchments, the method was applied to sub-catchments of the Murrumbidgee River Basin, Australia for two potential forest-cover change scenarios. The adjusted FDCs were used to developed new input time series to the daily river planning model. This allows an assessment of the impacts of forest cover change on water uses at both a local and regional scale.},

abstract = {Studies that address the potential effects of climate and land use changes on surface water quality are scarce in the Mediterranean region. In the present work, the impacts of climate and land use changes on nutrient and copper exports from a humid Mediterranean catchment (S{\~{a}}o Louren{\c{c}}o) were evaluated using the SWAT model. SWAT reproduced reasonably well total nitrogen (TN), phosphorus (TP) and copper (Cu) exports in S{\~{a}}o Louren{\c{c}}o, providing an adequate baseline scenario as well as a suitable model parameterization for assessing the impacts of climate and land use changes under the A1B and B1 emission scenarios for the end of the 21st century (2071–2100). Land use changes scenarios were generated along the same storylines as climate change scenarios to assess the combined effects of the two stressors. Climate changes itself led to a decline in annual TN and TP exports under both emission scenarios mostly due to a decrease in runoff and erosion induced by a reduction in rainfall, but it hardly affected Cu exports largely due to its strong immobilization in soils. Land use changes per se resulted in an increase in streamflow, but the changes in water quality varied markedly according to the scenarios. A substantial decrease in TN, TP and Cu exports was observed under scenario A1B, due to a reduction in vineyard areas. Under scenario B1, however, TP exports decreased much less while TN exports hardly changed, reflecting differences in the preferential transport pathways of these compounds. Cu exports also remained the same, as no changes occurred in the vineyard areas. The combination of climate and land use change scenarios revealed additive impacts on the exports of all three contaminants, emphasizing the importance of integrated approaches to define adaptive land management practices that can ensure the future sustainability of Mediterranean water resources.},

abstract = {Aiming at developing real time water balance modelling for irrigation scheduling, this study assesses the accuracy of the soil water balance model CRITERIA, developed by the hydro-meteorological service of the Emilia-Romagna region (Italy). The model consists of (i) an algorithm for coupling the surface flow components (i.e. Richards equation), and (ii) various modules which may be applicable to different topographical and environmental conditions. In this study, CRITERIA was applied to simulate the soil water balance for an orange orchard in semi-arid Mediterranean conditions (Eastern Sicily, insular Italy) during the cropping season 2011. The model was implemented by varying the evapotranspiration rates (ET) as input; ET fluxes were estimated by using satellite-based approach and the Penman-Monteith expression for reference rates, or were directly measured by the eddy covariance technique and the sap flow heat pulse method for transpiration. Model outputs, in term of soil moisture, were validated with direct measures of volumetric soil water content obtained by time domain reflectrometry (TDR) probes. Results of the study proved the reliability of CRITERIA to reproduce the soil moisture profile at the experimental site. The model performance was significantly high when direct measurements of crop water demand were included as input for model application. The satellite-based approach provided reliable crop evapotranspiration estimates, confirming the utility of the remote sensing techniques as support for water management in agriculture.},

abstract = {The skill of hydrologic models, such as those used in operational flood prediction, is currently restricted by the availability of flow gauges and by the quality of the streamflow data used for calibration. The increased availability of remote sensing products provides the opportunity to further improve the model forecasting skill. A joint calibration scheme using streamflow measurements and remote sensing derived soil moisture values was examined and compared with a streamflow only calibration scheme. The efficacy of the two calibration schemes was tested in three modelling setups: 1) a lumped model; 2) a semi-distributed model with only the outlet gauge available for calibration; and 3) a semi-distributed model with multiple gauges available for calibration. The joint calibration scheme was found to slightly degrade the streamflow prediction at gauged sites during the calibration period compared with streamflow only calibration, but improvement was found at the same gauged sites during the independent validation period. A more consistent and statistically significant improvement was achieved at gauged sites not used in the calibration, due to the spatial information introduced by the remotely sensed soil moisture data. It was also found that the impact of using soil moisture for calibration tended to be stronger at the upstream and tributary sub-catchments than at the downstream sub-catchments.},

abstract = {Mountain areas in Mediterranean regions constitute key monitoring points for climate variability and its impacts, but long time datasets are not always available due to the difficult access to high areas, relevant for capturing temperature and precipitation regimes, and the predominance of cloudy remote sensing images during the snow season. Sierra Nevada National Park (South Spain), with altitudes higher than 3500 m a.s.l., is part of the Global Change in Mountain Regions network. Snow occurrence just 40 km from the seaside determines a wide range of biodiversity, a snowmelt fluvial regime, and the associated ecosystem services. This work presents the local trend analysis of weather variables at this area together with additional snow-related variables. For this, long term point and distributed observations from weather stations and remote sensing sources were studied and used as input and calibration datasets of a physically based snow model to derive long term series of mean and maximum daily fraction of snow covered area, annual number of days with snow, annual number of days with precipitation, mean and maximum mean daily snow water equivalent, and snowmelt and evaporation volumes. The joint analysis of weather and snow variables showed a decrease trend in the persistence and extent of the snow cover area. The precipitation regime, rather than the temperature trend, seems to be the most relevant driver on the snow regime forcing in Mediterranean areas. This poses a constraint for rigorous scenario analysis in these regions, since the precipitation pattern is poorly approximated by climatic models in these regions.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the issues related to the use of validation in hydrological model calibration. Traditionally, models are calibrated and then assessed on an independent period (split-sample) to determine their adequacy in simulating streamflow as compared to observations. In this study, two hydrological models and three North American catchments are used to evaluate the effects of using validation to assess the model parameters' robustness on the model's actual simulation capabilities and accuracy in simulating streamflow. The length of the calibration period is increased from 1 to 16 years, and for each case a large number of randomly selected combinations of years are used for calibration and for validation using the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency metric. The calibrated model is then run on an independent 8-year test-period to assess the model's actual performance in simulation mode in unknown conditions. The process is bootstrapped 30 times to ensure the robustness of the results. The tests pit the calibration/validation methods on increasing calibration period lengths against a full calibration on the entire available dataset. Results show that the calibration on the full dataset is the optimal strategy as it generates the most robust parameter sets, provides the best model accuracy on an independent testing period and does not require assumption-making on the modeler's part. The calibrated parameter sets for each test-case were evaluated using the relative bias and correlation metrics, which revealed that the method transfers well to these two other metrics. Results also demonstrate the pitfalls of the commonly used split-sampling strategy, where good parameter sets may be discarded due to model performance discrepancies between calibration and validation periods. The conclusions point to the need to use as many years as possible in the calibration step and to entirely disregard the validation aspect under certain conditions.},

abstract = {Some scientists argue, with reference to Popper's scientific philosophical school, that models cannot be verified or validated. Other scientists and many practitioners nevertheless use these terms, but with very different meanings. As a result of an increasing number of examples of model malpractice and mistrust to the credibility of models, several modelling guidelines are being elaborated in recent years with the aim of improving the quality of modelling studies. This gap between the views and the lack of consensus experienced in the scientific community and the strongly perceived need for commonly agreed modelling guidelines is constraining the optimal use and benefits of models. This paper proposes a framework for quality assurance guidelines, including a consistent terminology and a foundation for a methodology bridging the gap between scientific philosophy and pragmatic modelling. A distinction is made between the conceptual model, the model code and the site-specific model. A conceptual model is subject to confirmation or falsification like scientific theories. A model code may be verified within given ranges of applicability and ranges of accuracy, but it can never be universally verified. Similarly, a model may be validated, but only with reference to site-specific applications and to pre-specified performance (accuracy) criteria. Thus, a model's validity will always be limited in terms of space, time, boundary conditions and types of application. This implies a continuous interaction between manager and modeller in order to establish suitable accuracy criteria and predictions associated with uncertainty analysis. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Short range probabilistic forecasts are derived from an operational ensemble prediction system using neighbourhood post-processing and conversion into categorical predictions by decision threshold optimization. Forecast skill is modelled for two different types of users. We investigate the balance between false alarms and missed events and the implications of the scales at which forecast information is communicated. 5 Results show that ensemble predictions objectively outperform the corresponding deterministic control forecasts at low precipitation intensities when an optimal probability threshold is used. Thresholds estimated from a short forecast archive are robust with respect to forecast range and season and can be extrapolated towards extreme values to estimate severe weather guidance. Numerical weather forecast value is found to be limited: the highest usable precipitation intensities have return periods of 10 a few years only, with resolution limited to several tens of kilometres. Implied precipitation warnings fall short of common skill requirements for high impact weather, confirming the importance of human expertise, nowcasting information and the potential of machine learning approaches. The verification methodology presented here provides a benchmark for high precipitation forecasts, based on metrics that are relatively easy to compute and explain to non-experts.},
annote = {Summary
The paper presents a methodology to optimize high-intensity precipitation warnings using an ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. They define two types of user and optimize the probability threshold that renders higher warning skill.
It is interesting that they use the f-score as a target metric, but they use a beta coefficient of 2, i.e., they try to minimize the missed events claiming that the cost of a false alarm is smaller than the cost of a missed event. It is also interesting how they compute the total probability, because they apply a triangular kernel to smooth the continuous probability distribution (in their case is needed because AROME has only 17 members).
Since they deal with precipitation data, instead of discharge, they have to preprocess both the observed and forecasted precipitation fields to deal with the spatial locations of the storms. They have also analysed the sensitivity of their method to the ensemble dressing, the spatial buffering (both in observations and forecasts), the precipitation intensity, the time dimension (diurnal cycle, season, accumulation timescale).},

abstract = {Over the years much literature on geology, hydrogeology and hygienic aspects has been written and in a lot of countries this information is used by policy makers, project managers, engineers and technicians to construct machine- drilled wells in their countries. Machine-drilled wells are often very expensive and not aff ordable by large parts of the population in developing countries. Another option is to drill ‘shallow' water wells (up to about 35 meter depth) by hand, so reducing the price of a well by a factor 4 -10 compared to a machine-drilled borehole. This cost reduction not only enables NGOs and Governments to construct more water wells, but also ‘opens the door' to villagers, farmers, schools and small communities to have a well constructed independently through the private sector. Although most of the existing manual drilling enterprises are technically able to drill boreholes, mistakes are easily made during the construction and development of the wells. Furthermore good well construction alone does not ensure good water quality and sustained yield from the well over many years. In order to achieve that, know-how on geology and groundwater is important. However, many technical workers of manual drilling enterprises may have limited education. Much of the available literature on geology, hydrogeology and hygiene cannot easily be understood without an advanced education. Technical workers are used to learn through experience and repetition. Of course training could be given to these workers but classroom training alone is known to be insuffi cient for drilling teams. They need to relate theoretical information to the real practical problems which occur regularly while working on drilling sites.},

abstract = {Land use and hydrology are interdependent, so that land use modeling could benefit from hydrologic modeling. This study aims to integrate spatial predictions of hydrologic variables as provided by a hydrologic model into a land use model for a rapidly urbanizing catchment in India. The benefits of this integration are quantified by comparing predictions of a land use model that uses a basic set of explanatory variables to a land use model that additionally uses the modeled hydrologic variables. Our results indicate that the integration of the hydrologic variables improved the model accuracy indicated by overall accuracy (+3 and + 4 percentage points (pp)), class specific user and producer accuracies (up to +8 pp) and figure of merit (+4 and + 5.3 pp) when compared with land use classifications at two points in time. Moreover, the land use patterns show that the integration of the hydrologic variables helped to avoid allocation errors.},

Se estudia c{\'{o}}mo influye el uso de variables obtenidas de la modelaci{\'{o}}n hidrol{\'{o}}gica en las predicciones de usos del suelo del modelo CLUE-S

M{\'{e}}todos:
Variables explicativas
Conjunto "b{\'{a}}sico": variables socioecon{\'{o}}micas y biof{\'{i}}sicas como densidad de poblaci{\'{o}}n, distancia a carreteras, distancia a r{\'{i}}os, altitud, pendiente, orientaci{\'{o}}n y tipo de suelo. De estas variables, todas menos la densidad de poblaci{\'{o}}n son est{\'{a}}ticas, es decir, no permiten predecir cambio.
Conjunto mejorado: se a{\~{n}}aden 12 variables obtenidas de la simulaci{\'{o}}n hidrol{\'{o}}gica con SWAT. Se generan estas variables para dos periodos: 1989-99 y 2000-08. Todas ellas son, por tanto, variables din{\'{a}}micas.
En ambos conjuntos se eliminan variables correlacionadas con un coeficiente de Pearson superior a 0.7; del par de variables correlacionadas, se prescinde de la que obtiene peor ROC en el modelo de regresi{\'{o}}n log{\'{i}}stica

Modelo CLUE-s (Verburg, 2002) Paquete lulcc de R
Simula din{\'{a}}micamente la competencia entre clases de uso del suelo para generar cambios de uso del suelo. Se compone de dos m{\'{o}}dulos. El primero genera la demanda total de cada uno de los usos de suleo en todo el {\'{a}}mbito de estudio. El segundo asigna dicha demanda a las celdas en las que se divide el {\'{a}}rea partir de mapas de probabilidad (resultado de la regresi{\'{o}}n log{\'{i}}stica binaria de cada clase), reglas de decisi{\'{o}}n (p.ej., zonas urbanas no pasan a ser bosque) y elasticidades en la conversi{\'{o}}n (la facilidad con la que una clase de suelo se convierte). La asignaci{\'{o}}n de cada celda a una clase sigue un proceso iterativo hasta que se cumple la demanda.

Procedimiento
Se extrae una muestra de cada clase de uso de suelo con el 20{\%} de las celdascon dicho uso. Para evitar la influencia de la autocorrelaci{\'{o}}n espacial, se impide que se escojan celdas adyacentes. Esta muestra se divide en dos, una para calibrar y otra para validar espacialmente.
Se entrena el modelo para las variables del segundo periodo (2009-10). El modelo se valida temporalmente con las variables del primer periodo (1989-99). Adem{\'{a}}s, para analizar la importancia de las variables hidrol{\'{o}}gicas, se utilizan las variables hidrol{\'{o}}gicas del primer periodo para predecir los usos del segundo periodo. Por {\'{u}}ltimo, se extrapola linealmente la demanda de uso del suelo al a{\~{n}}o 2029-30 para generar un mapa de usos del suelo en dicha fecha.
Los par{\'{a}}metros de elasticidad se atribuyen seg{\'{u}}n la experiencia.

Evaluaci{\'{o}}n
El modelo de regresi{\'{o}}n log{\'{i}}stica se eval{\'{u}}a por medio del {\'{a}}rea bajo la curva ROC (paquete ROCR de R). La influencia de cada una de las variables en la predicci{\'{o}}n (directa o inversamente proporcional) se estudia con el odds ratio. Se estudia la matriz de confusi{\'{o}}n para establecer el {\%} de cambio y persistencia correctamente simulado; sobre esto se calcula el "figure of merit" como el cociente entre el cambio correctamente simulado y el total del cambio.

Resultados
Modelo de regresi{\'{o}}n log{\'{i}}stica
En el modelo mejorado, todas las variables hidrol{\'{o}}gicas menos tres fueron utilizadas para alguna clase de suelo. Se obtienen valores buenos de ROC, por encima de 0.7 para todas las clases menos matorral y pasto. Al a{\~{n}}adir las variables hidrol{\'{o}}gicas, mejora el rendimiento de la regresi{\'{o}}n log{\'{i}}stica.

Modelo CLUE-s
El rendimiento en la clasificaci{\'{o}}n fue mejor en 2000-01 que en 2009-10. Nivel bajo de rendimiento general (50-63{\%}), en parte debido a la confusi{\'{o}}n entre clases de vegetaci{\'{o}}n semi-natural debido al momento del a{\~{n}}o en el que se tome la imagen y a la dificultad en diferenciar algunas clases de cultivo. Las clases con mejor precisi{\'{o}}n son bosques y zonas urbanas, mientras que la clase con peor precisi{\'{o}}n son los cultivos. el modelo es capaz de representar tanto el cambio de los usos del suelo como su persistencia. La mejor del "figure of merit" muestra la utilidad de las variables hidrol{\'{o}}gicas.

Discusi{\'{o}}n
El rendimiento del modelo es muy sensible a la resoluci{\'{o}}n. Al reducir la resoluci{\'{o}}n (aumentar el tama{\~{n}}o de celda) aumenta sensiblemente el rendimiento.
La inclusi{\'{o}}n de variables hidrol{\'{o}}gicas mejora el rendimiento del modelo incluso cuando {\'{e}}stas no son actuales. Sin embargo, esta mejora supone un esfuerzo computacional que s{\'{o}}lo mejora marginalmente el rendimiento.
Los resultados a futuro pueden mejorarse mediante modelos de demanda de clases del suelo m{\'{a}}s complejos.},

abstract = {The European Landscape Convention encourages the inventory and characterization of landscapes for environmental management and planning actions. Among the range of data sources available for landscape classification, remote sensing has substantial applicability, although difficulties might arise when available data are not at the spatial resolution of operational interest. We evaluated the applicability of two remote sensing products informing on land cover (the categorical CORINE map at 30m resolution and the continuous NDVI spectral index at 1km resolution) in landscape classification across a range of spatial resolutions (30m, 90m, 180m, 1km), using the Cantabrian Mountains (NW Spain) as study case. Separate landscape classifications (using topography, urban influence and land cover as inputs) were accomplished, one per each land cover dataset and spatial resolution. Classification accuracy was estimated through confusion matrixes and uncertainty in terms of both membership probability and confusion indices. Regarding landscape classifications based on CORINE, both typology and number of landscape classes varied across spatial resolutions. Classification accuracy increased from 30m (the original resolution of CORINE) to 90m, decreasing towards coarser resolutions. Uncertainty followed the opposite pattern. In the case of landscape classifications based on NDVI, the identified landscape patterns were geographically structured and showed little sensitivity to changes across spatial resolutions. Only the change from 1km (the original resolution of NDVI) to 180m improved classification accuracy. The value of confusion indices increased with resolution. We highlight the need for greater effort in selecting data sources at the suitable spatial resolution, matching regional peculiarities and minimizing error and uncertainty.},

abstract = {This paper describes the structure of JGrass-NewAge: a system for hydrological forecasting and modelling of water resources at the basin scale. It has been designed and implemented to emphasize the comparison of modelling solutions and reproduce hydrological modelling results in a straightforward manner. It is composed of two parts: (i) the data and result visualization system, based on the Geographic Information System uDig and (ii) the component-based modelling system, built on top of the Object Modelling System v3. Modelling components can be selected, adapted, and connected according to the needs of the modeller and then executed within the uDig spatial toolbox. Hence, the system provides an ideal and modern integration of models and GIS without invalidating existing solutions. Compared to traditional hydrological models, which are built upon monolithic code, JGrass-NewAge allows for multiple modelling solutions for the same physical process, provided they share similar input and output constraints. Modelling components are connected by means of a concise scripting language. Furthermore, the system utilizes the Pfafstetter numbering scheme to represent the digital watershed model; the adaption of this topological classification of a basin with respect to NewAge is explained in this paper. Finally, the system application for the Fort Cobb watershed and its results are presented. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Iberian Peninsula precipitation and river flow regimes are characterized by large values of inter-annual variability, with large disparities between wet and dry years, especially in southern Iberia. This situation is a major problem for water resources management in general, and for the production of hydroelectricity in particular. Hydroelectric production represents, in an average year of precipitation, 20{\%} of the total Spanish electricity production (and 35{\%} for Portuguese production). Its absolute value, however, can vary by a factor of three between wet and dry years. We have assessed the impact of the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) on winter precipitation and river flow regimes for the three main international Iberian river basins, namely the Douro (north), the Tejo (centre) and the Guadiana (south). Results show that the large inter-annual variability in the flows of these three rivers is largely modulated by the NAO phenomenon. Throughout most of the 20th century, the January-to-March river flow is better correlated with the December to February (DJF) NAO index than is the simultaneous (DJF) river flow. Correlation values for the period 1973–98 are highly significant (−0.76 for Douro, −0.77 for Tejo and −0.79 for Guadiana), being consistently of higher magnitude than those obtained over previous decades. This impact of the NAO on winter river flow was quantified in terms of total Spanish potential hydroelectricity production. The important control exerted by the NAO and the recent positive trend in the NAO index contribute to a significant decrease in the available flow. This reduction represents an important hazard for the two Iberian economies because of its negative impact on water-dependent resources, such as intensive agriculture and hydroelectric power production.},

abstract = {This paper is the outcome of a community initiative to identify major unsolved scientific problems in hydrology motivated by a need for stronger harmonisation of research efforts. The procedure involved a public consultation through online media, followed by two workshops through which a large number of potential science questions were collated, prioritised, and synthesised. In spite of the diversity of the participants (230 scientists in total), the process revealed much about community priorities and the state of our science: a preference for continuity in research questions rather than radical departures or redirections from past and current work. Questions remain focused on the process-based understanding of hydrological variability and causality at all space and time scales. Increased attention to environmental change drives a new emphasis on understanding how change propagates across interfaces within the hydrological system and across disciplinary boundaries. In particular, the expansion of the human footprint raises a new set of questions related to human interactions with nature and water cycle feedbacks in the context of complex water management problems. We hope that this reflection and synthesis of the 23 unsolved problems in hydrology will help guide research efforts for some years to come.},

abstract = {Characterization of snow is critical for understanding Earth's water and energy cycles. Maps of snow from MODIS have seen growing use in investigations of climate, hydrology, and glaciology, but the lack of rigorous validation of different snow mapping methods compromises these studies. We examine three widely used MODIS snow products: the "binary" (i.e., snow yes/no) global snow maps that were among the initial MODIS standard products; a more recent standard MODIS fractional snow product; and another fractional snow product, MODSCAG, based on spectral mixture analysis. We compare them to maps of snow obtained from Landsat ETM+ data, whose 30. m spatial resolution provides nearly 300 samples within a 500. m MODIS nadir pixel. The assessment uses 172 images spanning a range of snow and vegetation conditions, including the Colorado Rocky Mountains, the Upper Rio Grande, California's Sierra Nevada, and the Nepal Himalaya. MOD10A1 binary and fractional fail to retrieve snow in the transitional periods during accumulation and melt while MODSCAG consistently maintains its retrieval ability during these periods. Averaged over all regions, the RMSE for MOD10A1 fractional is 0.23, whereas the MODSCAG RMSE is 0.10. MODSCAG performs the most consistently through accumulation, mid-winter and melt, with median differences ranging from -0.16 to 0.04 while differences for MOD10A1 fractional range from -0.34 to 0.35. MODSCAG maintains its performance over all land cover classes and throughout a larger range of land surface properties. Characterizing snow cover by spectral mixing is more accurate than empirical methods based on the normalized difference snow index, both for identifying where snow is and is not and for estimating the fractional snow cover within a sensor's instantaneous field-of-view. Determining the fractional value is particularly important during spring and summer melt in mountainous terrain, where large variations in snow, vegetation and soil occur over small distances and when snow can melt rapidly. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This study enhances an existing global hydrological model (GHM), Xanthos, by adding a new water management module that distinguishes between the operational characteristics of irrigation, hydropower, and flood control reservoirs. We remapped reservoirs in the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) database to the 0.5spatial resolution in Xanthos so that a single lumped reservoir exists per grid cell, which yielded 3790 large reservoirs. We implemented unique operation rules for each reservoir type, based on their primary purposes. In particular, hydropower reservoirs have been treated as flood control reservoirs in previous GHM studies, while here, we determined the operation rules for hydropower reservoirs via optimization that maximizes long-term hydropower production. We conducted global simulations using the enhanced Xanthos and validated monthly streamflow for 91 large river basins, where high-quality observed streamflow data were available. A total of 1878 (296 hydropower, 486 irrigation, and 1096 flood control and others) out of the 3790 reservoirs are located in the 91 basins and are part of our reported results. The Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) value (after adding the new water management) is ≥0.5 and ≥0.0 in 39 and 81 basins, respectively. After adding the new water management module, model performance improved for 75 out of 91 basins and worsened for only 7. To measure the relative difference between explicitly representing hydropower reservoirs and representing hydropower reservoirs as flood control reservoirs (as is commonly done in other GHMs), we use the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R2). Out of the 296 hydropower reservoirs, the NRMSE is {\textgreater}0.25 (i.e., considering 0.25 to represent a moderate difference) for over 44{\%} of the 296 reservoirs when comparing both the simulated reservoir releases and storage time series between the two simulations. We suggest that correctly representing hydropower reservoirs in GHMs could have important implications for our understanding and management of freshwater resource challenges at regional-to-global scales. This enhanced global water management modeling framework will allow the analysis of future global reservoir development and management from a coupled human-earth system perspective.},

abstract = {A biophysically based distributed parameter ecohydrological catchment model, TOPOG-RM, is described which predicts the dynamic interactions between soil-vegetation-atmosphere systems over a catchment. The physiological control on transpiration is formulated using canopy resistance defined as a function of the net assimilation rate, the relative humidity and CO                        2 concentration at the leaf surface. Rainfall infiltration, runoff and redistribution are simulated with the Richards equation and evapotranspiration is calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation. Two innovative features of the model are (1) coupling of the vegetation atmosphere system by changing the value of the vapour pressure deficit of air in the canopy, and (2) the plant carbon balance, which allows the simulation of plant growth using a saturation rate kinetics formulation. The model was validated using evapotranspiration, soil moisture and leaf area index measurements from Wagga Wagga, N.S.W., Australia, for a period of 1992-1993. The calculated evapotranspiration was in good agreement with the observations. The soil moisture content at various depths was well simulated for two typical sites. The model also reasonably reproduced leaf area index of wheat and canola for two growing seasons. The success of the model simulations was due to the reasonably realistic treatment of the soil and canopy processes. The sensitivity analysis indicated that (1) the maximum assimilation rate of carbon affects canopy transpiration significantly, and (2) the total drainage is sensitive to the lower boundary conditions and the saturated hydraulic conductivity. TOPOG-IRM is a valuable tool in studying catchment responses; under different land management practices. However, the application of the model is limited by the large amount of data required regarding soil and vegetation properties, and their spatial distribution.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the notion of similarity often used in the regionalization studies of hydrological models. We compare two different visions of similarity: the apparent similarity defined on the basis of observable catchment properties, and behavioral similarity judged through the use of hydrological models. These two visions are generally assumed to be merged in regionalization studies: Catchments having apparently similar physical characteristics are assumed to have a similar hydrological behavior. In this paper, we wished to test the validity of this assumption. To this aim, we defined behavioral (hydrological) similarity on the basis of model parameter transferability. Then pools of hydrologically similar catchments are compared with pools of apparently physically similar catchments, as identified on the basis of physiographic catchment descriptors. The overlap between the two pools of similar catchments is analyzed, making it possible to judge the efficiency of the physical similarity measure and to identify hydrologically similar catchments in an ungauged context. The results show that the overlap between the two pools is significant for only 60{\%} of the catchments. For the other catchments, two major reasons were identified as contributing to the lack of overlap: (1) these catchments often have a quite specific hydrological behavior and (2) the role of the underground properties of the catchment on its hydrological behavior was not found to be accurately described by the available physical descriptors, meaning that more relevant catchment descriptors should be sought to better describe the geological and lithological context in hydrological terms.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract. All the major river systems in the contiguous United States (CONUS) (and many in the world) are impacted by dams, yet reservoir operations remain difficult to quantify and model due to a lack of data. Reservoir operation data are often inaccessible or distributed across many local operating agencies, making the acquisition and processing of data records quite time-consuming. As a result, large-scale models often rely on simple parameterizations for assumed reservoir operations and have a very limited ability to evaluate how well these approaches match actual historical operations. Here, we use the first national dataset of historical reservoir operations in the CONUS domain, ResOpsUS, to analyze reservoir storage trends and operations in more than 600 major reservoirs across the US. Our results show clear regional differences in reservoir operations. In the eastern US, which is dominated by flood control storage, we see storage peaks in the winter months with sharper decreases in the operational range (i.e., the difference between monthly maximum and minimum storage) in the summer. In the more arid western US where storage is predominantly for irrigation, we find that storage peaks during the spring and summer with increases in the operational range during the summer months. The Lower Colorado region is an outlier because its seasonal storage dynamics more closely mirrored those of flood control basins, yet the region is classified as arid, and most reservoirs have irrigation uses. Consistent with previous studies, we show that average annual reservoir storage has decreased over the past 40 years, although our analyses show a much smaller decrease than previous work. The reservoir operation characterizations presented here can be used directly for development or evaluation of reservoir operations and their derived parameters in large-scale models. We also evaluate how well historical operations match common assumptions that are often applied in large-scale reservoir parameterizations. For example, we find that 100 dams have maximum storage values greater than the reported reservoir capacity from the Global Reservoirs and Dams database (GRanD). Finally, we show that operational ranges have been increasing over time in more arid regions and decreasing in more humid regions, pointing to the need for operating policies which are not solely based on static values.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
annote = {Summary:   

The paper analysis the trends in the reservoir storage time series of 600 reservoirs in the data set ResOpsUS. The discovered trends are compared agains usual assumptions used in global hydrological models.  

Methods:

Variables they compute: * Fraction of storage filled (fraction filled, FF). Daily time series were resampled monthly. * Operating range: difference between the maximum and the minimum storage of a given month. * Month of highest median fraction. * Fraction filled anomal. The differecen between the fraction filled of a given month and the average of that month in the record period.  * Drought recovery time. * Recovery ratio.  

Results:

The results prove regional differences: * Humid regions have in general a lower fraction filled than arid regions. * Flood control reservoirs have a lower fraction filled and less seasonality. * Hydropower reservoirs have a stable franction filled. * Irrigation and water supply reservoirs have the strongest seasonality.  The data aligns with other studies that point out a negative trend in reservoir storage.  The data supports the classification of reservoirs in 2 classes (irrigation, non-irrigation) used in many models. However, the assumption of constant operating rules contrasts with the seasonality observed. The data also supports the common assumption that reservoir storage stays between 10-85{\%}.  They found inconsistencies in the maximum capacity reported by GRanD in 100 reservoirs.},

abstract = {Estimating precipitation over large spatial areas remains a challenging problem for hydrologists. Sparse ground-based gauge networks do not provide a robust basis for interpolation, and the reliability of remote sensing products, although improving, is still imperfect. Current techniques to estimate precipitation rely on combining these different kinds of measurements to correct the bias in the satellite observations. We propose a novel procedure that, unlike existing techniques, (i) allows correcting the possibly confounding effects of different sources of errors in satellite estimates, (ii) explicitly accounts for the spatial heterogeneity of the biases and (iii) allows the use of non overlapping historical observations. The proposed method spatially aggregates and interpolates gauge data at the satellite grid resolution by focusing on parameters that describe the frequency and intensity of the rainfall observed at the gauges. The resulting gridded parameters can then be used to adjust the probability density function of satellite rainfall observations at each grid cell, accounting for spatial heterogeneity. Unlike alternate methods, we explicitly adjust biases on rainfall frequency in addition to its intensity. Adjusted rainfall distributions can then readily be applied as input in stochastic rainfall generators or frequency domain hydrological models. Finally, we also provide a procedure to use them to correct remotely sensed rainfall time series.We apply the method to adjust the distributions of daily rainfall observed by the TRMM satellite in Nepal, which exemplifies the challenges associated with a sparse gauge network and large biases due to complex topography. In a cross-validation analysis on daily rainfall from TRMM 3B42 v6, we find that using a small subset of the available gauges, the proposed method outperforms local rainfall estimations using the complete network of available gauges to directly interpolate local rainfall or correct TRMM by adjusting monthly means. We conclude that the proposed frequency-domain bias correction approach is robust and reliable compared to other bias correction approaches. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Desarrollar un m{\'{e}}todo de correcci{\'{o}}n del error en mediciones satelitales de precipitaci{\'{o}}n basado en datos de pluvi{\'{o}}metros. El ajuste se realiza sobre los par{\'{a}}metros estacionarios de un modelo estoc{\'{a}}stico de precipitaci{\'{o}}n que describen la precipitaci{\'{o}}n en funci{\'{o}}n de su frecuencia, intensidad y autocorrelaci{\'{o}}n de periodos h{\'{u}}medos y secos
Este m{\'{e}}todo pretende superar los tres errores gen{\'{e}}ricos del ajuste de errores:
1. Separando el ajuste del error para la ocurrencia y la intensidad de la precipitaci{\'{o}}n.
2. Teniendo en cuenta potenciales diferenicas en la heterogeneidad espacial de las caracter{\'{i}}sticas de la precipitaci{\'{o}}n estoc{\'{a}}stica.
3. Haciendo uso de series temporales mediadas en el pasado.

Teor{\'{i}}as e hip{\'{o}}tesis:
- El ajuste del error se basa en la hip{\'{o}}tesis de la correlaci{\'{o}}n espacial en la diferencia de precipitaci{\'{o}}n diaria entre los pixels del TRMM y los pluvi{\'{o}}metros.

Ajuste del error de los SMP
1. Agregar los SMP de los pluvi{\'{o}}metros a la resoluci{\'{o}}n del sat{\'{e}}lite en aquellos pixels con pluvi{\'{o}}metros.
2. Interpolar los SMP agregados desde los pixels con pluvi{\'{o}}metro a los que no disponen de ellos.
3. Interpolar a los p{\'{i}}xeles sin pluvios los SMP obtenidos de las mediciones de sat{\'{e}}lite de los pixeles con pluvi{\'{o}}metro.
4. Calcular el error en los pixels sin pluvi{\'{o}}metro: 3. - 2.

Se utiliza quantile mapping para transformar las mediciones de sat{\'{e}}lite de tal manera que la nueva distribuci{\'{o}}n iguale a la distribuci{\'{o}}n de las mediciones de precipitaci{\'{o}}n corregidas.

Metodolog{\'{i}}a:
- Como par{\'{a}}metro de rendimiento del modelo se utiliza el error absoluto medio (MAE).
- Se utilizan simulaciones de Monte Carlo para evaluar la sensibilidad y propiedades del m{\'{e}}todo de ajuste.
- Ajuste de los par{\'{a}}metros del modelo estoc{\'{a}}stico para cada pluvio. y pixel.
- Ajuste del error en pixels con pluvios: 1) agregar los SMP de los pluvio. contenidos en el pixel, 2) corregir los SMPs del sat{\'{e}}lite con los valores agregados, 3) calcular MAE.
- Ajuste del error en pixels sin pluvios: 1) interpolaci{\'{o}}n con ordinary kriging, 2) simulaciones de Monte Carlo, 3) validaci{\'{o}}n con TRMMv7 y jack-knifing.
- Correci{\'{o}}n de series temporales: quantile mapping sobre un {\'{u}}nico pluvio.

Resultados:

- M{\'{e}}todo de correci{\'{o}}n de error: 
1) pixels con pluvios: MAE = 319 mm/y (45{\%} mejor que TRMMV6), 
2) pixels sin pluvio: MAE = 443 mm/y (entre TRMMV6 y v7), 
3) La mejora del rendimiento al incrementar la red es cada vez menor. Incluso redes muy densas tendr{\'{a}}n error.
4) El m{\'{e}}todo alcanza la predicci{\'{o}}n de la varianza del TRMMV7 para redes muy poco densas. Supera la descripci{\'{o}}n de la ocurrencia de lluvia.
5) Correcci{\'{o}}n de series temporales: MAE = 8,3 mm/m (correcto). Limitaciones por las mediciones de sat{\'{e}}lite y la correci{\'{o}}n de p{\'{i}}xeles err{\'{o}}neamente sin lluvia.

La ventaja del modelo es su parsimonia (10 par{\'{a}}metros frente a los 144 del TRMMV7) y su capacidad de correci{\'{o}}n para redes muy poco densas. 

Limitaciones:
- La incapacidad de los sat{\'{e}}lites para detectar las caracter{\'{i}}sticas de precipitaciones a peque{\~{n}}a escala.
- Aunque el m{\'{e}}todo propuesto genera estacasticamente precipitaci{\'{o}}n en aquellos d{\'{i}}as en los que TRMM no registr{\'{o}} lluvia, no es capaz de reproducir todos los d{\'{i}}as de lluvia registrados en un pluvi{\'{o}}metro.

An efficient evaluation framework must be able to spot issues and limitations and provide feedback to the system developers. In regional systems, the expertise of analysts on duty is a major component of the daily evaluation. On the other hand, large scale systems need to be complemented with semi-automated tools to evaluate the quality of forecasts equitably in every part of their domain.This article presents the current status of the monitoring and evaluation framework of the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS). For each grid point of the European river network, 10-day ensemble streamflow predictions are evaluated against a reference simulation which uses observed meteorological fields as input to a calibrated hydrological model. Performance scores are displayed over different regions, forecast lead times, basin sizes, as well as in time, considering average scores for moving 12-month windows of forecasts. Skilful predictions are found in medium to large rivers over the whole 10-day range. On average, performance drops significantly in river basins with upstream area smaller than 300km2, partly due to underestimation of the runoff in mountain areas. Model limitations and recommendations to improve the evaluation framework are discussed in the final section.},

abstract = {Changes in streamflow timing are studied in 27 mountain rivers in Spain, in the context of climate warming. The studied rivers are characterized by a highflows period in spring due to snowmelt, although differences in the role of snow and consequently in the timing of flows are observed amongst cases. We calculated for every year of the studied period (1976-2008) various hydrological indices that enable locating the timing of spring flows within the annual hydrologic regime, including the day of 75{\%} of mass, and the day of spring maximum. The evolution of these indices was compared with that of seasonal precipitation and temperature, and trends in time were calculated. Results show a general negative trend in the studied indices which indicates that spring peaks due to snowmelt are shifting earlier within the hydrological year. Spring temperatures, which show a significant increasing trend, are the main co-variable responsible for the observed changes in the streamflow timing. In a second set of analyses we performed hydrological simulations with the SWAT model, in order to estimate changes in streamflow timing under projected warming temperatures. Projections show further shifting of spring peak flows along with a more pronounced low water level period in the summer. The simulations also allowed quantifying the role of snowfall-snowmelt on the observed changes in streamflow.},

abstract = {This article presents the modeling of multivariate extreme values using copulas. Our approach allows us to model the dependence structure independently of the marginal distributions, which is not possible with standard classical methods. The methodology has been applied on two different problems in hydrology. The first application is concerned with the combined risk in the framework of frequency analysis. Four copulas have been tested on peak flows from the watershed of Peribonka in Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada. The second application relates to the joint modeling of peak flows and volumes. Three copulas have been applied to the watershed of the Rimouski River in Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada. This approach using copulas is promising since it allows us to take into account a wide range of correlation which can happen in hydrology.},

abstract = {The prediction of streamflow at ungauged sites is one of the fundamental challenges to hydrologists today. While major progress has been made in the regionalization of statistical flow properties (e.g. extreme values), and methods for synthesis of event response at ungauged sites are widely applied, the estimation of continuous streamflow time-series is still very uncertain. The challenge of predicting the response at ungauged sites is often met through a process of parameter regionalization. Little attention has so far been given to the impact of new insights into model identification at gauged sites, e.g. regarding the problem of structural error, on this regionalization process. Questions that are addressed in this paper are the following: (1) What is the relationship between local parameter identifiability and catchment characteristics? (2) How is the uniqueness of catchments reflected in regionalization? (3) What is the result of local model structural uncertainty on the regionalization result? (4) How can we propagate local parameter uncertainty into predictions in ungauged basins and what is the result? A case study of 10 catchments located in the southeast of England is utilized to deal with these questions. The main conclusions from this study are that the uncertainty in the locally estimated model parameters is a function of their importance in representing the response of a given catchment, model structural error hinders identification of a parameter to represent a certain process and therefore hinders the regionalization, and the uncertainty in the calibrated parameters can be propagated to ungauged sites using a weighted regression approach. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The AdUKIH method is applied on three daily streamflow gauging stations from the European part of Turkey, the Thrace region. The AdUKIH enables one to change the parameter 0.9 in the UKIH method and also introduces different block sizes, which is limited to five days in the original UKIH method.

@article{Haberlandt2001,
abstract = {This study investigates possibilities for the regionalisation of flow components within large river basins. One main purpose is the derivation of an empirical relationship for the estimation of the average base flow index (i.e. the ratio of base flow to total flow, BFI), which can be included into simplified models in form of decision support systems aimed at rapid integrated water resources assessment. Based on results from the hydrological models ARC/EGMO and HBV in 25 mesoscale sub basins of the macroscale Elbe River Basin, the modelled BFI is regionalised for the whole German part of the Elbe Basin, divided into 114 subbasins. For regionalisation of the average BFI multiple regression (MREG) and two geostatistical approaches (ordinary kriging (OK) and external drift kriging (EDK)) are applied using different physical catchment attributes and observed climate data as independent variables. The average base flow index is strongly related to topographical, pedological, hydrogeological and precipitation characteristics and less influenced by land cover/land use properties of the catchments. As indicated by cross validations, both EDK and MREG are suitable for regionalising the BFI with coefficients of determination of 0.80 and 0.77, respectively. Furthermore, the plausibility of the estimated BFI values is shown by comparisons with parameters calculated from statistical and fractal analysis of daily flow time series, which represent a strong relation to the regionalised BFI values. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Arid regions are characterized by high variability in the arrival of rainfall, and species found in these areas have adapted mechanisms to ensure the capture of this scarce resource. In particular, the rooting strategies employed by vegetation can be critical to their survival. However, land surface models currently prescribe rooting profiles as a function of only the plant functional type of interest with no consideration for the soil texture or rainfall regime of the region being modeled. Additionally, these models do not incorporate the ability of vegetation to dynamically alter their rooting strategies in response to transient changes in environmental forcings or competition from other plant species and therefore tend to underestimate the resilience of these ecosystems. To address the simplicity of the current representation of roots in land surface models, a new dynamic rooting scheme was incorporated into the framework of the distributed ecohydrological model tRIBS+VEGGIE. The new scheme optimizes the allocation of carbon to the root zone to reduce the perceived stress of the vegetation, so that root profiles evolve based upon local climate and soil conditions. The ability of the new scheme to capture the complex dynamics of natural systems was evaluated by comparisons to hourly timescale energy flux, soil moisture, and vegetation growth observations from the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, Arizona. Robust agreement was found between the model and observations, providing confidence that the improved model is able to capture the multidirectional interactions between climate, soil, and vegetation at this site.},

abstract = {The depletion of groundwater resources threatens food and water security in India. However, the relative influence of groundwater pumping and climate variability on groundwater availability and storage remains unclear. Here we show from analyses of satellite and local well data spanning the past decade that long-term changes in monsoon precipitation are driving groundwater storage variability in most parts of India either directly by changing recharge or indirectly by changing abstraction. We find that groundwater storage has declined in northern India at the rate of 2 cm yr−1 and increased by 1 to 2 cm yr−1 in southern India between 2002 and 2013. We find that a large fraction of the total variability in groundwater storage in north-central and southern India can be explained by changes in precipitation. Groundwater storage variability in northwestern India can be explained predominantly by variability in abstraction for irrigation, which is in turn influenced by changes in precipitation. Declining precipitation in northern India is linked to Indian Ocean warming, suggesting a previously unrecognized teleconnection between ocean temperatures and groundwater storage.},

abstract = {Vegetation plays a vital role in the global hydrological cycle, water supply and aquatic functions. How vegetation responds to future environmental change poses one of the largest uncertainties in climate model predictions. Distur-bance, both natural (e.g., wildfire, insect outbreaks, disease, windstorms, drought) and anthropogenic (e.g., timber har-vesting, land conversion), can have a profound effect on hy-drological processes through the impacts on vegetation dy-namics. With climate change, natural disturbances are be-coming more frequent and catastrophic. This, together with growing human disturbance, will undoubtedly affect water resources and consequently have significant implications for land managers and policy makers. Ecohydrology is a science dealing with the interactions be-tween ecosystems and hydrological processes, and many re-cent ecohydrological studies have focused on climate–soil– vegetation interactions in both natural and managed sys-tems (e.g., Rodriguez-Iturbe, 2000; D'Odorico et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2012a). Ecohydrology has advanced rapidly in the past few decades, which is reflected in the exponen-tial growth in the number of both publications and citations (Wang et al., 2012b). Despite such advances, a better under-standing of both the mechanisms and consequences of vege-tation changes for the water cycle is still required to develop effective adaptation strategies that minimize the adverse ef-fects of hydrological alterations. This special issue assembles a collection of 13 research articles to further our understand-ing of hydrological responses to vegetation dynamics under accelerated environmental and land use changes. The spatial scales of these articles range from individual plants to continent. In particular, this special issue focuses on the following four aspects of recent advances in ecohy-drological science.},

A major problem is the high variability encountered in the recession behaviour of individual segments. The segments represent different stages in the outflow process, and a physically based short-term or seasonal influence on the recession rate adds to the problem of deriving a characteristic recession.

abstract = {The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Ensemble Prediction System (EPS) is described. In addition to an unperturbed (control) forecast, each ensemble comprises 32 10-day forecasts starting from initial conditions in which dynamically defined perturbations have been added to the operational analysis. The perturbations are constructed from singular vectors of a time-evolution operator linearized around the short-range-forecast trajectory. These singular vectors approximately determine the most unstable phase-space directions in the early part of the forecast period, and are estimated using a forward and adjoint linear version of the ECMWF numerical weather-prediction model. An appropriate norm is chosen, and relationships between the structures of these singular vectors at initial time and patterns showing the sensitivity of short-range forecast error to changes in the analysis are discussed. A methodology to perform a phase-space rotation of the singular vectors is described, which generates hemispheric-wide perturbations and renormalizes them according to analysis-error estimates from the data-assimilation system.

The validation of the ensembles is given firstly in terms of scatter diagrams and contingency tables of ensemble spread and control-forecast skill. The contingency tables are compared with those from a perfect-model ensemble system; no significant differences are found in some cases. Brier scores for the probability of European flow clusters are presented, which indicate predictive skill up to forecast-day 8 with respect to climatological probabilities. The dependence of these scores on flow-dependent model errors is also discussed. Finally, ensemble-member skill-score distributions are presented, which confirm the overall satisfactory performance of the EPS, particularly in summer and autumn 1993. In winter, cases of poor performance over Europe were associated with the occurrence of a split westerly flow with a blocking high and/or a cut-off low in the verifying analysis.

Two cases are studied in detail, one having large ensemble dispersion, the other corresponding to a more predictable situation. The case studies are used to illustrate the range of ensemble products routinely disseminated to ECMWF Member States. These products include clusters of flow types, and probability fields of weather elements.},

A curve predicting changes in the total LAI of mountain ash forest was constructed from ground-based observations and their correlation with Landsat Thematic Mapper measurements of the transformed normalized difference vegetation index (TNDVI). A further curve for mountain ash canopy LAI was constructed from destructive LAI measurements and stem diameter measurements. The curves were incorporated within Macaque, a large-scale, physically based water balance model which was applied to three forested catchments (total area 145 km(2)). The model was used to evaluate the effect of changes in LAI on predicted stream flow over an 82-year period spanning the 1939 wildfires which burnt most of the area. The use of the LAI curves induced improvement in the predicted hydrographs relative to the case for constant LAI, but the change was not large enough to account for all of the difference in water yield between old-growth and regrowth forests. Of a number of possibilities, concomitant changes in leaf conductance with age were suggested as an additional control on stream flow. These were estimated using data on stand sapwood area per unit leaf area and coded into Macaque. The hydrograph predicted using both the LAI curves and a new leaf conductance versus age curve accurately predicted the observed long-term changes in water yield. We conclude that LAI is a partial control on long-term yield changes, but that another 'water use efficiency per unit LAI' control is also operative. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

In this context, a hundred of badlands areas are distributed along the ranges of the Depression. This morphologies occurrence has been associated to the combination of different factors: bedrock, climate, deforestation, slope terracing and field crop abandonment. In this way, most of the hydrological basins show a mosaic of contrasted environments: badlands, meadows, meadows with shrubs and reforested slopes. This study presents the analyses of the hydrological response on the Aragu{\'{a}}s catchment, which is monitored for recording discharges from the most extreme environments: badlands and reforested slopes. The results show great differences on discharge generation, both by runoff generation processes and by its frequency and water volume. Reforested environments decreases flooding and erosion risks, but also generate a big reduction of water resources disposability.},

abstract = {A regionalisation methodology has been applied to catchments in England and Wales enabling estimation of daily flows for any catchment in the region for which physical data and records of rainfall and temperature are available. The rainfall-runoff model IHACRES has been calibrated to 60 catchments to obtain a set of dynamic response characteristics (DRCs) describing the hydrological behaviour within the region. Physical catchment descriptors (PCDs) indexing topography, soil type, climate and land cover were collated and linked to the hydrological model by overlaying catchment boundaries with a geographical information system. Relationships were derived to describe the DRCs in terms of the PCDs so that the model may be used to simulate flow for any catchment in the region, given the driving variables, i.e. rainfall and temperature. In the England and Wales region, rainfall loss parameters have been defined in terms of land use, climate and soil type, whilst hydrograph separation parameters were characterised using topographical and soil variables. The set of DRC-PCD relationships, which were obtained by balancing the dual objectives of hydrological integrity and statistical significance, has been satisfactorily validated on two additional catchments within the region. Analysis of calibration errors was aided by sensitivity tests at one of these catchments in which flow response to variations in DRCs was assessed. Finally, a simple land use scenario demonstrates an application of the methodology in which variation in PCDs may be used to assess the impacts of environmental change.},

abstract = {Finding an operational parameter vector is always challenging in the application of hydrologic models, with over-parameterization and limited information from observations leading to uncertainty about the best parameter vectors. Thus, it is beneficial to find every possible behavioural parameter vector. This paper presents a new methodology, called the patient rule induction method for parameter estimation (PRIM-PE), to define where the behavioural parameter vectors are located in the parameter space. The PRIM-PE was used to discover all regions of the parameter space containing an acceptable model behaviour. This algorithm consists of an initial sampling procedure to generate a parameter sample that sufficiently represents the response surface with a uniform distribution within the “good-enough” region (i.e., performance better than a predefined threshold) and a rule induction component (PRIM), which is then used to define regions in the parameter space in which the acceptable parameter vectors are located. To investigate its ability in different situations, the methodology is evaluated using four test problems. The PRIM-PE sampling procedure was also compared against a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler known as the differential evolution adaptive Metropolis (DREAMZS) algorithm. Finally, a spatially distributed hydrological model calibration problem with two settings (a three-parameter calibration problem and a 23-parameter calibration problem) was solved using the PRIM-PE algorithm. The results show that the PRIM-PE method captured the good-enough region in the parameter space successfully using 8 and 107 boxes for the three-parameter and 23-parameter problems, respectively. This good-enough region can be used in a global sensitivity analysis to provide a broad range of parameter vectors that produce acceptable model performance. Moreover, for a specific objective function and model structure, the size of the boxes can be used as a measure of equifinality.},

abstract = {1. A large proportion of the world's biodiversity is reportedly threatened by habitat loss and climate change. However, there are few studies that investigate the interaction between these two threats using empirical data. 2. Here, we investigate interactions between climate change and land-use change in the future distribution of 23 dominant tree species in mainland Spain. We simulated changes up to year 2100 using a climate-dependent Stochastic Patch Occupancy Model, parameterized with colo- nization and extinction events recorded in 46 596 survey plots. 3. We estimated that the distribution of 17 out of 23 tree species are expanding and hence not at equilibrium with the climate. However, climate change will make the future occupancy of 15 species to be lower than expected if climate, and habitat, remained stable (baseline scenario). 4. Climate change, when combined with the loss of 20{\%} of the habitat, was estimated to reduce species occupancies (relative to baseline projections) by an average of 23{\%} if habitat loss was spatially clumped, and by 35{\%} if it was scattered. If habitat loss occurred in areas already impacted by human activities, species occupancies would be reduced by 26{\%}. Land- use changes leading to habitat gain (i.e. creation through reforestation) could slightly mitigate the effects of climate change, but a 20{\%} increment in habitat would reduce climate change- driven losses in species occupancies by only 3{\%}. 5. Synthesis and applications. The distributions of the most common tree species in mainland Spain are expanding, but climate change threatens to reduce this expansion by 18{\%} for 15 of the 23 studied species. Moreover, if the habitat of these species is simultaneously lost, the occupancies of all of them will be reduced further, with variation depending on the spatial pattern of the lost habitats. However, we did not detect synergies between climate change and habitat loss. The combined effect (with 20{\%} habitat loss) was 5–13{\%} less than what it would be if the effects were additive. Importantly, reforestation could partially offset the negative effects of climate change, but complete mitigation would require an increase in forested land of 80{\%}, and the prioritization of territories that are less impacted by human activities.},

Dam operators make decisions based on experience and often uncertain information. In this study information generally available to dam operators, like inflow into the reservoir and storage levels, was used to derive fuzzy rules describing the way a reservoir is operated. Using an artificial neural network capable of mimicking fuzzy logic, called the ANFIS adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system, fuzzy rules linking inflow and storage with reservoir release were determined for 11 reservoirs in central Asia, the US and Vietnam. By varying the input variables of the neural network, different configurations of fuzzy rules were created and tested. It was found that the release from relatively large reservoirs was significantly dependent on information concerning recent storage levels, while release from smaller reservoirs was more dependent on reservoir inflows. Subsequently, the derived rules were used to simulate reservoir release with an average Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.81.},

Developing a general reservoir operating scheme suitable for use in large-scale hydrological models can improve our understanding of the broad impacts of dams operation. Here we present a novel use of artificial neural networks to map the general input/output relationships in actual operating rules of real world dams. We developed a new general reservoir operation scheme (GROS) which may be added to daily hydrologic routing models for simulating the releases from dams, in regional and global-scale studies. We show the advantage of our model in distinguishing between dams with various storage capacities by demonstrating how it modifies the reservoir operation in respond to changes in capacity of dams. Embedding GROS in a water balance model, we analyze the hydrological impact of dam size as well as their distribution pattern within a drainage basin and conclude that for large-scale studies it is generally acceptable to aggregate the capacity of smaller dams and instead model a hypothetical larger dam with the same total storage capacity; however we suggest limiting the aggregation area to HUC 8 sub-basins (approximately equal to the area of a 60 km or a 30 arc minute grid cell) to avoid exaggerated results.},

abstract = {As the 21st century unfolds, agriculture will face a series of challenges—in the United States and globally—in providing sufficient food, fiber, and fuel to support a growing global population while our natural resources, environmental health, and available arable land decline and climate changes. The unprecedented nature of these challenges creates a growing sense of urgency for transformative changes in agriculture to accelerate progress towards achieving sustainable agricultural systems that maximize production and economic return for producers, minimize environmental degradation, and adapt to changing climate. Achieving such a transformation requires an improved understanding of the complexities of how agro-ecosystems function at multiple scales (i.e., fields to watersheds or landscapes). Long-term research and data collection are essential to achieving this understanding; at stake are the security and safety of our food production systems, our natural resources, and our environment. Over the past 10 years, there have been frequent calls for the creation of a ‗Long-Term Agro-Ecosystem Research‘ (LTAR) network, similar to the National Science Foundation‘s Long–Term Ecological Research (LTER) network, to provide a sophisticated platform for research on the sustainability of U.S. agricultural systems. The U.S. Department of Agriculture‘s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) currently maintains approximately 23 benchmark experimental watersheds and ranges that collect long-term data on agricultural sustainability, climate change, ecosystem services, and natural resource conservation at the watershed or landscape scale. Some of these sites have been collecting data for nearly a hundred years. Here we present a vision for how a subset of these sites could be used to form the core of an LTAR network. Eventually, such a network would link ARS sites with partner sites operated by universities, other research institutions, and (or) other Federal agencies to support multidisciplinary research and funding efforts addressing regional- and national-scale questions using shared research protocols. Such a long-term agro- ecosystem research network would provide the knowledge to substantially improve both agricultural sustainability and the delivery of ecosystem services to a society that increasingly demands that agriculture be safe, environmentally sound, and socially responsible, in addition to being productive and economically viable.},

abstract = {Accurate global river discharge estimation is crucial for advancing our scientific understanding of the global water cycle and supporting various downstream applications. In recent years, data-driven machine learning models, particularly the Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) model, have shown significant promise in estimating discharge. Despite this, the applicability of LSTM models for global river discharge estimation remains largely unexplored. In this study, we diverge from the conventional basin- lumped LSTM modeling in limited basins. For the first time, we apply an LSTM on a global 0.25° grid, coupling it with a river routing model to estimate river discharge for every river reach worldwide. We rigorously evaluate the performance over 5332 evaluation gauges globally for the period 2000-2020, separate from the training basins and period. The grid-scale LSTM model effectively captures the rainfall-runoff behavior, reproducing global river discharge with high accuracy and achieving a median Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) of 0.563. It outperforms an extensively bias-corrected and calibrated benchmark simulation based on the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, which achieved a median KGE of 0.466. Using the global grid-scale LSTM model, we develop an improved global reach-level daily discharge dataset spanning 1980 to 2020, named GRADES-hydroDL. This dataset is anticipated to be useful for a myriad of applications, including providing prior information for the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission. The dataset is openly available via Globus.},

abstract = {Many of the scientific and societal challenges in understanding and preparing for global envi- ronmental change rest upon our ability to understand and predict the water cycle change at large river basin, continent, and global scales. However, current large-scale land models (as a component of Earth Sys- tem Models, or ESMs) do not yet reflect the best hydrologic process understanding or utilize the large amount of hydrologic observations for model testing. This paper discusses the opportunities and key chal- lenges to improve hydrologic process representations and benchmarking in ESM land models, suggesting that (1) land model development can benefit from recent advances in hydrology, both through incorporat- ing key processes (e.g., groundwater-surface water interactions) and new approaches to describe multiscale spatial variability and hydrologic connectivity; (2) accelerating model advances requires comprehensive hydrologic benchmarking in order to systematically evaluate competing alternatives, understand model weaknesses, and prioritize model development needs, and (3) stronger collaboration is needed between the hydrology and ESM modeling communities, both through greater engagement of hydrologists in ESM land model development, and through rigorous evaluation of ESM hydrology performance in research watersheds or Critical Zone Observatories. Such coordinated efforts in advancing hydrology in ESMs have the potential to substantially impact energy, carbon, and nutrient cycle prediction capabilities through the fundamental role hydrologic processes play in regulating these cycles.

Disentangling the impact of these two drivers on ecosystem carbon and water cycling is difficult because they are often correlated, and experimental tools for manipulating atmospheric demand in the field are lacking. Consequently, the role of atmospheric demand is often not adequately factored into experiments or represented in models5, 6, 7. Here we show that atmospheric demand limits surface conductance and evapotranspiration to a greater extent than soil moisture in many biomes, including mesic forests that are of particular importance to the terrestrial carbon sink8, 9. Further, using projections from ten general circulation models, we show that climate change will increase the importance of atmospheric constraints to carbon and water fluxes in all ecosystems. Consequently, atmospheric demand will become increasingly important for vegetation function, accounting for {\textgreater}70{\%} of growing season limitation to surface conductance in mesic temperate forests. Our results suggest that failure to consider the limiting role of atmospheric demand in experimental designs, simulation models and land management strategies will lead to incorrect projections of ecosystem responses to future climate conditions.},

Inverse distance weighting method (IDWM) is one of the most frequently used methods for estimating missing rainfall values at a gage based on values recorded at all other available recording gages. In spite of the method's wide success and acceptability, it suffers from major conceptual limitations. Conceptual improvements are incorporated in the IDWM method that led to several modified distance-based methods. A data-driven model that uses artificial neural network concepts and a stochastic interpolation technique, kriging, are also developed and tested in the current study. These methods are tested for estimation of missing precipitation data. Historical precipitation data from 20 rain-gauging stations in the state of Kentucky, USA, are used to test the improvised methods and derive conclusions about the efficacy of incorporated improvements. Results suggest that the conceptual revisions can improve estimation of missing precipitation records by defining better weighting parameters and surrogate measures for distances that are used in the IDWM. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The high climate sensitivity of hydrologic systems, the importance of those systems to society, and the imprecise nature of future climate projections all motivate interest in characterizing uncertainty in the hydrologic impacts of climate change. We discuss recent research that exposes important sources of uncertainty that are commonly neglected by the water management community, especially, uncertainties associated with internal climate system variability, and hydrologic modeling. We also discuss research exposing several issues with widely used climate downscaling methods. We propose that progress can be made following parallel paths: first, by explicitly characterizing the uncertainties throughout the modeling process (rather than using an ad hoc “ensemble of opportunity”) and second, by reducing uncertainties through developing criteria for excluding poor methods/models, as well as with targeted research to improve modeling capabilities. We argue that such research to reveal, reduce, and represent uncertainties is essential to establish a defensible range of quantitative hydrologic storylines of climate change impacts.},

First, we use an exact local expansion of the entropy function to prove almost sure consistency and central limit theorems for three of the most commonly used discretized information estimators. The setup is related to Grenander's method of sieves and places no assumptions on the underlying probability measure generating the data. Second, we prove a converse to these consistency theorems, demonstrating that a misapplication of the most common estimation techniques leads to an arbitrarily poor estimate of the true information, even given unlimited data. This inconsistency theorem leads to an analytical approximation of the bias, valid in surprisingly small sample regimes and more accurate than the usual formula of Miller and Madow over a large region of parameter space. The two most practical implications of these results are negative: (1) information estimates in a certain data regime are likely contaminated by bias, even if bias-corrected estimators are used, and (2) confidence intervals calculated by standard techniques drastically underestimate the error of the most common estimation methods.},

Recent findings The prevalence of intellectual disability across Asia appears to be consistent with western estimates at 0.06-1.3{\%}, with the exception being China at 6.68{\%}. In the only two studies of m{\_}ntal health conducted in Asia, the prevalence ranged from 4.4 to 48.3{\%}. Some of the common physical health problems among Singaporean adults with intellectual disability are obesity, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol. All Asian countries/territories have at least one law or policy that promotes the well being of persons with disabilities, with Japan being the only country that has a law specifically enacted for persons with intellectual disability. Although there is an array of services being offered for children and adults with intellectual disability across south-east Asia, there is also a variation in the proportion of countries that offer these services. Summary Overall, the challenge for Asia will be to develop a localized base of knowledge by conducting epidemiological studies, modeling after evidence-based practices, and evaluating its effectiveness. By adopting a scientific approach and formal publication of data, intellectual disability standards can be evaluated, managed, and improved in a systematic manner.},

abstract = {Flash floods are listed among the deadliest and costliest weather-driven hazard worldwide. Yet, only a few systems to predict flash floods run operationally in Europe. Recently, the European Precipitation Index based on Climatology (EPIC) was developed and then set up for daily flash flood early warning for an area covering most of the continent. EPIC is a purely rainfall-driven indicator based on the prediction of statistical threshold exceedence of the upstream precipitation to provide early warning up to 5days in advance. Its main assumption is that flash floods are directly and solely related to extreme accumulations of upstream precipitation. It does not take into account any geo-factors such as slope and land use or processes such as initial soil moisture, which can have a significant impact on the triggering of such events. This study proposes an enhanced version of EPIC through a dynamic and distributed runoff co-efficient which depends on the initial soil moisture. This co-efficient, namely the European Runoff Index based on Climatology (ERIC), is used to weigh each contribution of the upstream precipitation proportionally to the initial soil moisture. The evaluation based on 1year of daily runs proved that ERIC reaches a threat score of 0.5 if it forecasts a probability {\textgreater}35{\%} of exceeding the 20year return period of upstream runoff. This result is 0.16 higher than for EPIC. A case study of the flash flooding affecting central Europe in June 2013 demonstrated the ability of ERIC to successfully detect and locate the affected areas.},
annote = {Summary
The article presents the European Runoff Index based on Climatoloty (ERIC) methodology to predict flash floods. The methods builds on the previous European Precipitation Index based on Climatology (EPIC), but instead of being based only in precipitation, it is based on runoff (precipitation * runoff coefficient).

The notification criteria are tested on a complete year of data using a data set of observed flash floods as comparison. The selected criteria is the 35{\%} probability of exceeding the 20 year return period in at least two cells within a 30 km radius. Persistence was tested but skill degraded.

The paper also shows the performance of ERIC in a flash flood in June 2013 in Germany, Austria, Cezch Republic.},

abstract = {In this study we developed a methodology aimed at improving the assessment of inter-annual land cover dynamics from hard classified remotely sensed data in heterogeneous and resilient landscapes. The methodology is implemented for the Spanish Natural Park of Sierra de Ancares, where human interference during the last century has resulted in the destruction and fragmentation of the original land cover. We ran supervised classifications, with a maximum likelihood algorithm (Maxlike), on a temporal series of Landsat images (1991-2005), followed by an uncertainty assessment using fuzzy classifications and confusion indices (CIs). This allowed us to show how much (and where) of the resulting maps contained a substantial amount of error, distinguishing data that might be useful to measure land change from data that are not particularly useful when applying a post-classification comparison methodology. In this way, we can detect true changes not skewed by the effects of uncertainty. Even if patterns of change were always coherent amongst years, they were more realistic after reducing uncertainty, in spite of a substantial decrease in the number of available pixels (i.e. unmasked by the method). We then computed land cover dynamics by means of a model specifically designed to determine the frequency of disturbances (mainly fire events) and the vegetation recovery time during the study period. Model outputs showed correlated landscape patterns at a broad scale and provided useful results to explore land cover change from pattern to process.},

Resumen:
Se desarrolla una metodolog{\'{i}}a para evaluear la din{\'{a}}mica de cambio de usos del suelo interanual.

Datos:
1. 14 im{\'{a}}genes Landsat correspondientes a una serie de 14 a{\~{n}}os: bandas 1-5 y 7.
2. NDVI
3. Greeness de la transformaci{\'{o}}n Tasselled Cap.
4. Altitud y pendiente

Metodolog{\'{i}}a:
1. Clasificaci{\'{o}}n de las im{\'{a}}genes Lansat mediante maximum likelihook (MaxLike). Se definen 200 {\'{a}}reas de entranamiento consistentes en 50 pixels cada una. Una clasificaci{\'{o}}n no supervisada anterior permiti{\'{o}} identificar siete clases de suelo: bosque, pradera, arbutos, afloramiento rocoso, suelo desnudo, superficies de agua y urbano. Los dos {\'{u}}ltimos se desechan.
El rendimiento de la clasificaci{\'{o}}n se hace a partir de unos puntos de control y el c{\'{a}}lculo de matrices de confusi{\'{o}}n y la precisi{\'{o}}n asociada.
2. Evaluaci{\'{o}}n de la incertidumbre a trav{\'{e}}s de fuzzy k-means. Primeramente se calcula la distancia eucl{\'{i}}dea normalizada (dc) de un pixel x al centro de cada una de las clases de suelo. El grado de pertenencia de un pixel a una clase c (pc) se calcula como el dc de dicha clase sobre la suma de los dcs de todas las clases. Por {\'{u}}ltimo, la incertidumbre en la clasificaci{\'{o}}n de un pixel se mide a trav{\'{e}}s del {\'{i}}ndice de confusi{\'{o}}n (CI), el cual compara los pc de las dos clases m{\'{a}}s probables.
A partir de la incertidumbre se generan dos mapas en los que se mantienen el 75 y 50{\%} de puntos con menos incertidumbre (CI75 y CI50).
3. Din{\'{a}}mica del uso del suelo. Se comparan los cambios de usos de suelo en a{\~{n}}os consecutivos y en ventanas de dos a{\~{n}}os consecutivos. Se generan matrices de transici{\'{o}}n y se analizan dos par{\'{a}}metros: recurrencia del cambio y tiempo de la recuperaci{\'{o}}n de la vegetaci{\'{o}}n.

Resultados:
1. Clasificaci{\'{o}}n. Se obtienen una precisi{\'{o}}n sobre el 80{\%}. La precisi{\'{o}}n es menor en cubiertas no vegetadas; se compar{\'{o}} el {\'{a}}rea de suelo desnudo y el {\'{a}}rea quemada y el n{\'{u}}mero de incendios, obteniendo correlaciones pobres. La mayor precisi{\'{o}}n se obtuvo para bosques y arbustos.
2. An{\'{a}}lisis de incertidumbre. La mayor confusi{\'{o}}n se encunetra en zonas no vegetados. Los bosques y praderas tienen os menores valores de incertidumbre y los arbustos valores intermedios. La precisi{\'{o}}n glogal aumenta conforme se reduce la incertidumbre (CI75 y CI50).
3. Patrones de cambio en el paisaje.
- Clasificaci{\'{o}}n dura. 
Las zonas arbustivas dominan el paisaje. El suelo desnudo disminuy{\'{o}} ligeramente. Las praderas son el uso del suelo m{\'{a}}s estable. 
Se dientifican seis tipos de cambio: bosque-arbusto, arbusto-roquedo, arbusto-suelo desnudo. La magnitud del cambio parece estar sobrevalorada cuando se analiza el mapa CI100.
- An{\'{a}}lisis de incertidumbre.
Se reduce la magnitud del cambio, acerc{\'{a}}ndose a los valores de la cartograf{\'{i}}a comparada.
Una excesiva p{\'{e}}rdida de pixeles al eliminar la incertidumbre podr{\'{i}}a suponer una infravaloraci{\'{o}}n del cambio.
4. Modelado de la din{\'{a}}mica del paisaje
Se analiza la recurrencia y tiempo de recuperaci{\'{o}}n de los cambios bosque-arbusto y arbusto-suelo desnudo. 
Transici{\'{o}}n bosque-arbusto. Se obtienen recurrencias de 1 a partir de los datos filtrados y 2 sobre los datos completos. La transici{\'{o}}n de bosque a arbusto es la m{\'{a}}s importante en extensi{\'{o}}n. La recuperaci{\'{o}}n es de m{\'{a}}s de 4 a{\~{n}}os.
Trasici{\'{o}}n arbusto-suelo desnudo. Tiempo de recuperaci{\'{o}}n de alrededor de 2 a{\~{n}}os.

Conclusi{\'{o}}n:
La tasa de cambio ha disminuido con el tiempo y se ha homogeneizado el paisaje.
Los patrones de cambio son m{\'{a}}s realistas a partir de la reducci{\'{o}}n de la incertidumbre.
La metodolog{\'{i}}a no es capaz de detectar si ha borrado {\'{a}}reas de verdadero cambio.

Limitaciones:
Esta metodolog{\'{i}}a no es capaz de identificar cambios dentro de una clase de uso del suelo, p.e. senescencia o fuegos de baja intensidad.},

abstract = {Land use/cover change (LUCC), as an important factor in global change, is a topic that has recently received considerable attention in the prospective modeling domain. There are many approaches and software packages for modeling LUCC, many of them are empirical approaches based on past LUCC such as CLUE-S, DINAMICA EGO, CA{\_}MARKOV and Land Change Modeler (both available in IDRISI). This study reviews the possibilities and the limits of these four modeling software packages. First, a revision of the methods and tools available for each model was performed, taking into account how the models carry out the different procedures involved in the modeling process: quantity of change estimate, change potential evaluation, spatial allocation of change, reproduction of temporal and spatial patterns, model evaluation and advanced modeling options. Additional considerations, such as flexibility and user friendliness were also taken into account. Then, the four models were applied to a virtual case study to illustrate the previous descriptions with a typical LUCC scenario that consists of four processes of change (conversion of forest to two different types of crops, crop abandonment and urban sprawl) that follow different spatial patterns and are conditioned by different drivers. The outputs were compared to assess the quantity of change estimates, the change potential and the simulated prospective maps. Finally, we discussed some basic criteria to define a "good" model. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Currently, climate change is a major concern around the world, especially because of the uncertainty associated with its possible consequences for society. Among them, fluvial alterations can be highlighted in basins whose flows depend on groundwater discharges and snowmelt. This is the case of the headwaters of the Tagus River basin, whose water resources, besides being essential for water uses within this basin, are susceptible to being transferred to the Segura River basin (both basins are in the Iberian Peninsula). This work studies the possible effects that the latest climate change scenarios may have on this transfer, one of the most important ones in southern Europe. In the first place, the possible alterations of the water cycle of the donor basin were estimated. To do this, a hydrological model was calibrated. Then, with this model, three climatic scenarios were simulated, one without climate change and two projections under climate change (Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 (RCP 4.5) and 8.5 (RCP 8.5)). The results of these three hydrological modelling scenarios were used to determine the possible flows that could be transferred from the Tagus River basin to the Segura River basin, by simulating the water resource exploitation system of the Tagus headwaters. The calibrated hydrological model predicts, for the simulated climate change scenarios, important reductions in the snowfalls and snow covers, the recharge of aquifers, and the available water resources. So, the headwaters of the Tagus River basin would lose part of its natural capacity for regulation. These changes in the water cycle for the climate change scenarios used would imply a reduction of around 70 {\%}-79 {\%} in the possible flows that could be transferred to the Segura basin, with respect to a scenario without climate change. The loss of water resources for the Segura River basin would mean, if no alternative measures were taken, an economic loss of EUR 380-425 million per year, due principally to decreased agricultural production.},

abstract = {Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have become increasingly popular for estimating the posterior probability distribution of parameters in hydrologic models. However, MCMC methods require the a priori definition of a proposal or sampling distribution, which determines the explorative capabilities and efficiency of the sampler and therefore the statistical properties of the Markov Chain and its rate of convergence. In this paper we present an MCMC sampler entitled the Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis algorithm (SCEM-UA), which is well suited to infer the posterior distribution of hydrologic model parameters. The SCEM-UA algorithm is a modified version of the original SCE-UA global optimization algorithm developed by Duan et al. [1992]. The SCEM-UA algorithm operates by merging the strengths of the Metropolis algorithm, controlled random search, competitive evolution, and complex shuffling in order to continuously update the proposal distribution and evolve the sampler to the posterior target distribution. Three case studies demonstrate that the adaptive capability of the SCEM-UA algorithm significantly reduces the number of model simulations needed to infer the posterior distribution of the parameters when compared with the traditional Metropolis-Hastings samplers.},

abstract = {There has been growing interest in Malaysia to increase the productivity of latex. This made accurate knowledge of rubber tree growth and age distribution a helpful decision making tool for the government, rubber plantation managers, and harvesters. Gathering this information using conventional methods is difficult, time consuming, and limited in spatial coverage. This paper presents hierarchical classification approach to obtain accurate map of rubber tree growth age distribution using SPOT-5 satellite imagery. The objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of pixel-based and object-oriented classifiers for rubber growth classification. At the first level, the general land cover was classified into eight land cover classes (soil, water body, rubber, mature oil palm, young oil palm, forest, urban area, and other vegetation) using Mahalanobis distance (MD), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Thereafter, the best classification map, k-NN output, was used to select only pixels that belong to the rubber class from the SPOT-5 image. The extracted pixels served as input into the next classification hierarchy where four classifiers, MD, k-NN, SVM, and decision tree (DT), were implemented to map rubber trees into three intra-classes (mature, middle-aged, and young rubbers). The result produced overall accuracy of 97.48{\%}, 96.90{\%}, 96.25{\%}, and 80.80{\%} for k-NN, SVM, MD, and DT respectively. The result indicates that object-oriented classifiers are better than pixel-based methods mapping rubber tree growth.},

For many years there was the lack of a coordinated effort and continuity of approach, which slowed the emergence of the manual drilling sector. Te development of the private manual well drilling sector was encouraged by three large small-scale irrigation projects funded by the World Bank and the European Union. Tere was, however, no spontaneous transfer of manual drilling from the irrigation sector to the rural water sup- ply sector. Advocacy of the methodology by UNICEF has demonstrated how manual drilling can complement other methods of sup- plying water to rural communities. UNICEF has funded several demonstration programs and the mapping of areas suitable for manual drilling in Niger. For a professional manual drilling sector to further develop in Niger there remains a need to simultaneously upgrade the technical ability and management efficiency of the drilling enterprises and to integrate a new cadre of quality control companies into manual drilling activities. Critically important for the completion of successful and sustainable rural water supply programs are improved training and follow-up for water users and a viable supply chain for pumps including maintenance. Tis applies throughout the rural water supply sector and is not restricted to manual drilling activities.},

abstract = {Root zone soil moisture plays an important role in water storage in hydrological processes. The recently launched Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission has produced a high-resolution assimilation product of global root zone soil moisture that can be applied to improve the performance of hydrological models. In this study, we compare three calibration approaches in the Beimiaoji watershed. The first approach is single-objective calibration, in which only observed streamflow is used as a benchmark for comparison with the other approaches. The second and third approaches use multi-objective calibration based on SMAP root zone soil moisture and observed streamflow. The difference between the second and third approaches is the metric used to characterize the root zone soil moisture. The second approach applies the mean, which was commonly used in previous studies, whereas the third approach applies the hydrologic complexity $\mu$, a dimensionless metric based on information entropy theory. These approaches are implemented to calibrate the distributed hydrological model MIKE SHE. Results show that the root zone soil moisture simulation is clearly improved, whereas streamflow simulation suffers from a slightly negative impact with multi-objective calibration. The hydrologic complexity $\mu$ performs better than the mean in capturing the features of root zone soil moisture.},

abstract = {This paper considers whether there is any added value in using seasonal climate forecasts instead of historical meteorological observations for forecasting streamflow on seasonal timescales over Europe. A Europe-wide analysis of the skill of the newly operational EFAS (European Flood Awareness System) seasonal streamflow forecasts (produced by forcing the Lisflood model with the ECMWF System 4 seasonal climate forecasts), benchmarked against the ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) forecasting approach (produced by forcing the Lisflood model with historical meteorological observations), is undertaken. The results suggest that, on average, the System 4 seasonal climate forecasts improve the streamflow predictability over historical meteorological observations for the first month of lead time only (in terms of hindcast accuracy, sharpness and overall performance). However, the predictability varies in space and time and is greater in winter and autumn. Parts of Europe additionally exhibit a longer predictability, up to 7 months of lead time, for certain months within a season. In terms of hindcast reliability, the EFAS seasonal streamflow hindcasts are on average less skilful than the ESP for all lead times. The results also highlight the potential usefulness of the EFAS seasonal streamflow forecasts for decision-making (measured in terms of the hindcast discrimination for the lower and upper terciles of the simulated streamflow). Although the ESP is the most potentially useful forecasting approach in Europe, the EFAS seasonal streamflow forecasts appear more potentially useful than the ESP in some regions and for certain seasons, especially in winter for almost 40{\%} of Europe. Patterns in the EFAS seasonal streamflow hindcast skill are however not mirrored in the System 4 seasonal climate hindcasts, hinting at the need for a better understanding of the link between hydrological and meteorological variables on seasonal timescales, with the aim of improving climate-model-based seasonal streamflow forecasting.},

abstract = {Hydrological model parameters are typically calibrated by observed streamflow data. This calibration strategy is questioned when the simulated hydrological variables of interest are not limited to streamflow. Well-performed streamflow simulations do not guarantee the reliable reproduction of other hydrological variables. One of the reasons is that hydrological model parameters are not reasonably identified. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)-derived total water storage change (TWSC) data provide an opportunity to constrain hydrological model parameterizations in combination with streamflow observations. In this study, a multi-objective calibration scheme based on GRACE-derived TWSC and streamflow observations was compared with the traditional single-objective calibration scheme based on only streamflow simulations. Two hydrological models were employed on 22 catchments in China with different climatic conditions. The model evaluations were performed using observed streamflows, GRACE-derived TWSC, and actual evapotranspiration (ET) estimates from flux towers and from the water balance approach. Results showed that the multi-objective calibration scheme provided more reliable TWSC and ET simulations without significant deterioration in the accuracy of streamflow simulations than the single-objective calibration. The improvement in TWSC and ET simulations was more significant in relatively dry catchments than in relatively wet catchments. In addition, hydrological models calibrated using GRACE-derived TWSC data alone cannot obtain accurate runoff simulations in ungauged catchments. This study highlights the importance of including additional constraints in addition to streamflow observations to improve performances of hydrological models.},

abstract = {Daily rainfall data are one of the basic inputs in hydrological and ecological modeling and in assessing water quality. However, most data series are too short to perform reliable and meaningful analyses and possess significant number of missing records. The study focuses on developing a methodology to fill the gaps in daily rainfall series considering data of twenty rainfall stations from Brahmani Basin, Rachi, India. A probabilistic approach is adopted to generate data for filling on missing points. The Poisson-gamma (PG) distributions were explored in the study as they possess useful properties to simultaneously model both the continuous (rainfall depth) and discrete (rainfall occurrence) components of daily rainfall. First, the PG distributions were fitted to the daily rainfall data of targeted stations and the parameters were estimated. The models were compared with the widely used inverse distance interpolation method. To compare the fit of the models, a dataset of size equal to the size of the observed dataset were generated. The means and percentages of days with no rainfall of observed and simulated datasets were very similar. However, PG distributions slightly overestimate the 95th percentile and underestimate the variance and 99th percentile. This indicates that the models do not capture well the extremely heavy rainfall events; hence, the PG distributions need to modify to capture better the extreme events. However, with respect to all statistics, the PG model performs better than the inverse distance interpolation method. The methodology considers two basic assumptions. • The rainfall data of missing period have similar statistical properties to the data from available periods. Fairly large amounts of data exist to generalize the parameters from the available periods to the points with no data. The assumption is also supported by the fact that, for the studied stations, the first and second halves of the available datasets possess similar statistical properties. • Spatial correlations exist among rainfall occurrence and amounts of neighboring stations. The fact is reasonable as fairly negative relationship were observed between correlation of daily rainfall and distances among the studied stations. Once the PG distributions were decided, samples were generated with the parameters of respective stations. The generated data for a station is completely random in nature and independent of the rainfall amounts of neighboring stations. To match the data, first the rainfall amount of the region is estimated as the weighted mean of rainfall amounts from four closest stations. Weights were taken as the inverse of the distances of the neighboring stations from the target station. Days were sorted from driest to wettest on the basis of the mean rainfall amounts of neighboring stations, and finally, the generated data were matched. Instead of using two separate models for generating continuous data (rainfall depth) with exact zero (no rainfall), the proposed method use a single model to model both components of daily rainfall simultaneously. The method resolves the problem of overestimating non-zero rainfall amount that arises while using traditional interpolation methods. However, the method may not work well when the neighboring stations are not close to the target station. Keywords:},

abstract = {Soil water extraction by plant roots results from plant and soil transport processes interacting at different space and time scales. At the single root scale, local soil hydraulic status and plant physiology strongly control water uptake. At the whole root system level, these local, spatially interacting processes, are integrated and modulated depending on the root system hydraulics and plant transpiration. Most often, architectural and physiological characteristics of the root system are poorly taken into account in water uptake studies. This work aims at (i) studying root water extraction by mature root systems from the single root to the whole root system scale and (ii) providing experimental data for the assessment of a detailed model of water transport in the soil–root system presented in a companion paper (Doussan et al., Plant Soil 2006, this issue). Based on the dynamic imaging of soil water depletion around roots, we examined the influence of root system architecture and soil hydraulic properties on water uptake. We worked with narrow-leaf lupin plants whose root system architecture ranged from taprooted to fasciculate. Plants were grown in large thin containers (rhizotron) filled with a translucent sand/clay mix growing medium. Water transfer in the soil, together with root water uptake, were monitored in laboratory experiments by means of 2D light transmission imaging. This technique enables the mapping of the soil water content at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Throughout water uptake events, we clearly observed and quantified the formation and movement of a water extraction front and of high gradients of soil water content next to the roots. The data obtained also demonstrate that water uptake is never restricted to a specific portion of a root and that the contribution of a specific portion of a root to the overall uptake varies with time and with the position of the root within the root system. Finally, we found that different root system architectures induced different water uptake patterns.},

Despite the popularity of CRR models, reports in the literature indicate that it is typically difficult, if not. impossible, to obtain unique optimal values for their parameters using automatic calibration methods. Unless the best set of parameters.associated with a given calibration data set chn be found, it is difficult to determine how sensitive the parameter estimates (and hence the model forecasts) are to factors such as input and output data error, model error, quantity and quality of data, objective function used, and so on. Results are presented that establish clearly the nature of the multiple optima P.r0b!em for the research CRR model SIXPAR. These results suggest that the CRR model optimization problem is more difficult than had been previously thought and that currently used local search procedures have a very low probability of successfully finding the optimal parameter sets. Next, the performance of three existing global search procedures are evaluated on the model SIXPAR. Finally, a powerful new global optimization procedure is presented, entitled the shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA) method, which was able to consistently locate the global optimum of the SIXPAR model, and appears to be capable of efficiently and effectively solving the CRR model optimization problem.},

@article{Williams2005,
abstract = {While it is generally believed that the magnitude and composition of vegetation cover influence land-atmosphere water and carbon fluxes, observations indicate that in some cases, fluxes are insensitive to land cover contrasts. This seeming inconsistency may be resolved by contrasting fluxes over short and long timescales. To explore this potential contrast, we developed and tested a model designed to simulate daily to decadal land surface water and carbon fluxes and vegetation dynamics for water-limited ecosystems. The model reproduces (R2 {\textgreater} 0.76) observed daily fluxes under increasing water limitation and captures representative dynamics of leaf area and fractional cover of dominant grass and wood vegetation. We parameterized the model for southern African savannas and conducted two sets of numerical experiments with either having fixed (static) grass and wood covers or allowing them to adjust dynamically with production. Static simulations reveal that the direct effect of rainfall on soil moisture is more important than the prevailing grass and wood cover states in controlling annual transpiration and production. Dynamic simulations indicate sensitivity of daily fluxes to vegetation cover states during high soil water periods. However, depletion of finite soil water prevents an integrated effect from lasting over interstorm to annual timescales. Correspondingly, while seasonal vegetation dynamics enhance seasonality in fluxes, vegetation dynamics have only minor influence on annual transpiration and production. In fact, annual rainfall explains most (R {\textgreater} 0.85) of the temporal variation in annual water and carbon fluxes. Hence, despite alteration of daily and seasonal distributions of fluxes, for water-limited ecosystems, vegetation dynamics have little effect on annual transpiration and production.},

Patterns that are induced neither by heterogeneity in soil properties nor by the local topography are generally explained as the result of spatial self-organization resulting from “symmetry-breaking instability” in nonlinear systems. In this case, the spatial dynamics are able to destabilize the homogeneous state of the system, leading to the emergence of stable heterogeneous configurations. Both deterministic and stochastic mechanisms may explain the self-organized vegetation patterns observed in nature.

abstract = {A trend of increasing streamflow has been observed in the Mississippi River (MR) basin since the 1940 s as a result of increased precipitation. Herein we show that increasing MR flow is mainly in its baseflow as a result of land use change and accompanying agricultural activities that occurred in the MR basin during the last 60 years. Agricultural land use change in the MR basin has affected the basin-scale hydrology: more precipitation is being routed into streams as baseflow than stormflow since 1940 s. We explain that the conversion of perennial vegetation to seasonal row crops, especially soybeans, in the basin since 1940 s may have reduced evapotranspiration, increased groundwater recharge, and thus increased baseflow and streamflow. This explanation is supported with a data analysis of the annually and monthly flow rates at various river stations in the MR basin. Results from this study will help to direct our effort in managing land use and in reducing nutrient levels in MR and other major rivers since nutrient concentrations and loads carried by storm water and baseflow are different. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A Regional Water Resources study was performed at basins within and draining to the Basque Country Region (N of Spain), with a total area of approximately 8500 km2. The objective was to obtain daily and monthly long-term discharges in 567 points, most of them ungauged, with basin areas ranging from 0.25 to 1850 km2. In order to extrapolate the calibrations at gauged points to the ungauged ones, a distributed and conceptually based model called TETIS was used. In TETIS the runoff production is modelled using five linked tanks at the each cell with different outflow relationships at each tank, which represents the main hydrological processes as snowmelt, evapotranspiration, overland flow, interflow and base flow. The routing along the channels' network couples its geomorphologic characteristics with the kinematic wave approach. The parameter estimation methodology tries to distinguish between the effective parameter used in the model at the cell scale, and the watershed characteristic estimated from the available information, being the best estimation without losing its physical meaning. The relationship between them can be considered as a correction function or, in its simple form, a correction factor. The correction factor can take into account the model input errors, the temporal and spatial scale effects and the watershed characteristics. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume the correction factor is the same for each parameter to all cells within the watershed. This approach reduces drastically the number of parameter to be calibrated, because only the common correction factors are calibrated instead of parameter maps (number of parameters times the number of cells). In this way, the calibration can be performed using automatic methodologies. In this work, the Shuffled Complex Evolution – University of Arizona, SCE-UA algorithm was used. The available recent year's data was used to calibrate the model in 20 of the most representative flow gauge stations in 18 basins with a Nash-Sutcliffe index higher than 0.6 (10 higher than 0.8). The calibrated correction factors at each basin were similar but not equal. The validation process (in time and space) was performed using the remaining data in all flow gauge stations (62), with 42 basins with a Nash-Sutcliffe index higher than 0.5 (25 higher than 0.7). Deficient calibration and validations were always related with flow gauge stations very close to the karstic springs. These results confirmed that it was feasible and efficient to use the SCE-UA algorithm for the automatic calibration of distributed conceptual models and the calibrated model could be used at ungauged basins. Finally, meteorological information from the past 50 years at a daily scale was used to generate a daily discharges series at 567 selected points.},

abstract = {In recent years a new theory of the evolution of drainage networks and associated landscapes has emerged, mainly in connection with the development of fractal geometry and of serf-organized criticality (SOC) concepts. This theory has much improved our understanding of the mechanisms which determine the structure of natural landscapes and their dynamics of evolution. In the first part of this paper the main ideas in the theory of landscape self-organization are outlined, and some remarkable features of the resulting structures are presented. In the second part we apply theoretical tools developed in the context of multifractal fields to the study of the scaling properties of the field of elevations of SOC landscapes. We observe that such landscapes appear to be more complex than simple self-affine fractals, although in some cases a simple fractal framework may be adequate for their description. We also show that multiple scaling may emerge as a result of heterogeneity in the field properties reflecting climate and geology.},

Total suspended sediment yield increases downstream faster than the basin area for rivers with undisturbed or slightly disturbed basins.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, The Author(s). Predicting root water uptake and plant transpiration is crucial for managing plant irrigation and developing drought-tolerant root system ideotypes (i.e. ideal root systems). Today, three-dimensional structural functional models exist, which allows solving the water flow equation in the soil and in the root systems under transient conditions and in heterogeneous soils. Yet, these models rely on the full representation of the three-dimensional distribution of the root hydraulic properties, which is not always easy to access. Recently, new models able to represent this complex system without the full knowledge of the plant 3D hydraulic architecture and with a limited number of parameters have been developed. However, the estimation of the macroscopic parameters a priori still requires a numerical model and the knowledge of the full three-dimensional hydraulic architecture. The objective of this study is to provide analytical mathematical models to estimate the values of these parameters as a function of local plant general features, like the distance between laterals, the number of primaries or the ratio of radial to axial root conductances. Such functions would allow one to characterize the behaviour of a root system (as characterized by its macroscopic parameters) directly from averaged plant root traits, thereby opening new possibilities for developing quantitative ideotypes, by linking plant scale parameters to mean functional or structural properties. With its simple form, the proposed model offers the chance to perform sensitivity and optimization analyses as presented in this study.},

abstract = {Many environmental scientists are analysing spatial data by geostatistical methods and interpolating from sparse sample data by kriging to make maps. They recognize its merits in providing unbiased estimates with minimum variance. Several statistical packages now have the facilities they require, as do some geographic information systems. In the latter kriging is an option for interpolation that can be done at the press of a few buttons. Unfortunately, the ease conferred by this allows one to krige without understanding and to produce unreliable and even misleading results. Crucial for sound kriging is a plausible function for the spatial covariances or, more widely, of the variogram. The variogram must be estimated reliably and then modelled with valid mathematical functions. This requires an understanding of the assumptions in the underlying theory of random processes on which geostatistics is based. Here we guide readers through computing the sample variogram and modelling it by weighted least-squares fitting. We explain how to choose the most suitable functions by a combination of graphics and statistical diagnostics. Ordinary kriging follows straightforwardly from the model, but small changes in the model function and its parameters can affect the kriging error variances. When kriging is automated these effects remain unknown. We explain the choices to be made when kriging, i.e. whether the support is at points or over blocks, and whether the predictions are global or within moving windows. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Drought events are of great importance in most Mediterranean climate regions because of the diverse and costly impacts they have in various economic sectors and on the environment. The effects of this natural hazard on rainfed crops are particularly evident. In this study the impacts of drought on two representative rainfed crops in Spain (wheat and barley) were assessed. As the agriculture sector is vulnerable to climate, it is especially important to identify the most appropriate tools for monitoring the impact of the weather on crops, and particularly the impact of drought. Drought indices are the most effective tool for that purpose. Various drought indices have been used to assess the influence of drought on crop yields in Spain, including the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Palmer drought indices (Palmer Drought Severity Index, PDSI; Palmer Z Index, Z Index; Palmer Hydrological Drought Index, PHDI; Palmer Modified Drought Index, PMDI), and the Standardized Palmer Drought Index (SPDI). Two sets of crop yield data at different spatial scales and temporal periods were used in the analysis. The results showed that drought indices calculated at different timescales (SPI, SPEI) most closely correlated with crop yield. The results also suggested that different patterns of yield response to drought occurred depending on the region, period of the year, and the drought timescale. The differing responses across the country were related to season and the magnitude of various climate variables.},

abstract = {Understanding photosynthesis and plant water management as a coupled process remains an open scientific problem. Current eco-hydrologic models characteristically describe plant photosynthetic and hydraulic processes through ad hoc empirical parameterizations with no explicit accounting for the main pathways over which carbon and water uptake interact. Here, a soil-plant-atmosphere continuum model is proposed that mechanistically couples photosynthesis and transpiration rates, including the main leaf physiological controls exerted by stomata. The proposed approach links the soil-to-leaf hydraulic transport to stomatal regulation, and closes the coupled photosynthesis-transpiration problem by maximizing leaf carbon gain subject to a water loss constraint. The approach is evaluated against field data from a grass site and is shown to reproduce the main features of soil moisture dynamics and hydraulic redistribution. In particular, it is shown that the differential soil drying produced by diurnal root water uptake drives a significant upward redistribution of moisture both through a conventional Darcian flow and through the root system, consistent with observations. In a numerical soil drying experiment, it is demonstrated that more than 50{\%} of diurnal transpiration is supplied by nocturnal upward water redistribution, and some 12{\%} is provided directly through root hydraulic redistribution. For a prescribed leaf area density, the model is then used to diagnose how elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and increased air temperature jointly impact soil moisture, transpiration, photosynthesis, and whole-plant water use efficiency, along with compensatory mechanisms such as hydraulic lift using several canonical forms of root-density distribution. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

La principal novedad del modelo es que incluye una representaci{\'{o}}n mecan{\'{i}}stica de la absorci{\'{o}}n radicular de agua y que optimiza simult{\'{a}}neamente los procesos hidr{\'{a}}ulicos y fotosint{\'{e}}ticos.

Teor{\'{i}}as e hip{\'{o}}tesis:
Modelo de absorci{\'{o}}n radicular del agua:
Aproximaci{\'{o}}n macrosc{\'{o}}pica que describe la planta como una red estructurada en la que cada capa est{\'{a}} directamente conectada al xylema. Calcula el flujo de agua en funci{\'{o}}n de los potenciales hidr{\'{a}}ulicas (cada capa del suelo, base del xylema, hojas y atm{\'{o}}sfera) y las conductancias (cada capa de suelo, xylema y estomas). Como resultado de ello se obtiene una formulaci{\'{o}}n de la transpiraci{\'{o}}n en funci{\'{o}}n de la disponibilidad de agua.

Modelo xylema-hoja ( fotos{\'{i}}ntesis):
Para describir la conductancia del xylema es necesario el potencial hidr{\'{a}}ulico de las hojas ($\psi$s). Para ello se formula la transpiraci{\'{o}}n en funci{\'{o}}n de la absorci{\'{o}}n de carbono; esta expresi{\'{o}}n se iguala a la primera de la transpiraci{\'{o}}n y permite el c{\'{a}}lculo del $\psi$s. 
De nuevo, la nueva expresi{\'{o}}n de la transpiraci{\'{o}}n requiere definir la conductancia de las estomas. Para ello se optimiza la ganancia neta de carbono (An) para un p{\'{e}}rdida de agua fija.
Se define tambi{\'{e}}n un modelo multicapa de atenuaci{\'{o}}n de la luz dentro del follaje.
Los resultados finales son la transpiraci{\'{o}}n (E), la tasa total de fotos{\'{i}}ntesis (A), y la eficiencia en el uso del agua (WUE = A/E).

Metodolog{\'{i}}a:
1. Se compara el modelo con datos de campo de dos semanas en Carolina del Norte.
2. Se estudia la variaci{\'{o}}n de la transpiraci{\'{o}}n y la asimilaci{\'{o}}n de carbono para tres disposiciones de ra{\'{i}}ces: constante, lineal y no lineal.
3. Se analizan las variaciones causadas en dos escenarios de cambio clim{\'{a}}tico: mayor concentraci{\'{o}}n de CO2 y mayor temperatura del aire.

Resultados:
1. El modelo reproduce correctamente las mediciones de humedad del suelo y evapotranspiraci{\'{o}}n.

2. - Las distribuciones radiculares con mayor proporci{\'{o}}n de biomasa en las capas superficiales resultan en contenidos de agua menor en la superficie.
- Estas distribuciones generan gradientes hidr{\'{a}}ulicos m{\'{a}}s marcado que producen ascensi{\'{o}}n de agua.
- La mayor ascensi{\'{o}}n aumenta la disponibilidad de agua, limita el estr{\'{e}}s h{\'{i}}drico y mejora la retenci{\'{o}}n de agua en capas inferiores.
- La distribuci{\'{o}}n no lineal es la m{\'{a}}s efectiva para conservar agua sin penalizar la asimilaci{\'{o}}n de carbono.

3. - Mayor CO2 supone una menor transpiraci{\'{o}}n y una mayor asimilaci{\'{o}}n de carbono (mayor WUE). Se reduce el flujo de agua ascendente al reducirse la absorci{\'{o}}n radicular.
- El incremento de la temperatura produce una mayor transpiraci{\'{o}}n sin afectar a la fotos{\'{i}}ntesis (menor WUE). Se acrecienta el ascenso de agua.

Limitaciones:
- El modelo de absorci{\'{o}}n radicular asume que la variaci{\'{o}}n del agua contenida en las plantas es despreciable y que, por tanto, la transpiraci{\'{o}}n es igual a la absorci{\'{o}}n radicular. Esto no es correcto para bosques.

abstract = {Vegetation affects water balance of the land sur- face by e.g. storage of precipitation water in the canopy and soil water extraction by transpiration. Therefore, it is essential to consider the role of vegetation in affecting water balance by taking into account the temporal dynamics of e.g. leaf area index, rooting depth and stomatal conductance in hydrological models. However until now, most conceptual hydrological models do not treat vegetation as a dynamic component. This paper presents an analysis of the effects of the application of two different complex vegetation models combined with a hydrological model on the model outputs evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge. Both model combinations were used for the assessment of the effects of climate change on water balance in a mesoscale catchment loctated in the Northeastern German Lowlands. One vegetation model assumes a static vegetation development independent from environmental conditions. The other vegetation model calculates dynamic development of vegetation based on photosynthesis, respiration, allocation, and phenology. The analysis of the results obtained from both model combinations indicated the importance of taking into account vegetation dynamics in hydrological models especially if such models are used for the assessment of the impacts of climate change on water balance components.},

abstract = {Conceptual hydrological modelling has under-utilised classical parameter analysis techniques (for both optimisation and uncertainty assessment) due to the prohibitively complicated nonsmooth geometry of typical parameter distributions. In the companion paper, a numerically robust model implementation framework was developed, based on stable time stepping schemes and careful threshold smoothing to eliminate the roughness of parameter surfaces. Here, this framework is exploited to enable parameter estimation using powerful and well-established techniques including: (i) Newton-type optimisation and (ii) principal-component-type (Hessian-based) uncertainty analysis. A case study using a representative rainfall-runoff-snow model illustrates the advantages of these previously unavailable methods, contrasting them with slower and less informative current approaches designed for nonsmooth functions. In addition to boosting the computational efficiency, the methods advocated in the paper yield more insight into improved model formulation and parameterisation (e.g., reducing model nonlinearity, detecting ill-conditioning and handling parameter multi-optimality). The impact of extreme model nonlinearity on model and parameter stability is also discussed, focusing on model identification aspects. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Throughout its historical development, hydrology as an earth science, but especially as a problem-centred engineering discipline has largely relied (quite successfully) on the assumption of stationarity. This includes assuming time invariance of boundary conditions such as climate, system configurations such as land use, topography and morphology, and dynamics such as flow regimes and flood recurrence at different spatiooral aggregation scales. The justification for this assumption was often that when compared with the temporal, spatial, or topical extent of the questions posed to hydrology, such conditions could indeed be considered stationary, and therefore the neglect of certain long-term non-stationarities or feedback effects (even if they were known) would not introduce a large error. However, over time two closely related phenomena emerged that have increasingly reduced the general applicability of the stationarity concept: the first is the rapid and extensive global changes in many parts of the hydrological cycle, changing formerly stationary systems to transient ones. The second is that the questions posed to hydrology have become increasingly more complex, requiring the joint consideration of increasingly more (sub-) systems and their interactions across more and longer timescales, which limits the applicability of stationarity assumptions. Therefore, the applicability of hydrological concepts based on stationarity has diminished at the same rate as the complexity of the hydrological problems we are confronted with and the transient nature of the hydrological systems we are dealing with has increased. The aim of this paper is to present and discuss potentially helpful paradigms and theories that should be considered as we seek to better understand complex hydrological systems under change. For the sake of brevity we focus on catchment hydrology. We begin with a discussion of the general nature of explanation in hydrology and briefly review the history of catchment hydrology. We then propose and discuss several perspectives on catchments: as complex dynamical systems, self-organizing systems, co-evolving systems and open dissipative thermodynamic systems. We discuss the benefits of comparative hydrology and of taking an informationtheoretic view of catchments, including the flow of information from data to models to predictions. In summary, we suggest that these perspectives deserve closer attention and that their synergistic combination can advance catchment hydrology to address questions of change.{\textcopyright}Author(s) 2014.

abstract = {The circulation of the ocean is usually divided into two parts, a wind-driven circulation that dominates in the upper few hundred meters, and a density-driven circulation that dominates below. The latter is called the ‘thermohaline' circulation because of the role of heating, cool- ing, freshening, and salinification in producing regional density differences within the ocean. The thermohaline circulation, for the most part, is an ‘overturning' circulation in which warm water flows poleward near the surface and is subsequently converted into cold water that sinks and flows equatorward in the in- terior. Radiocarbon measurements show that the thermohaline circulation turns over all the deep water in the ocean every 600 years or so},

abstract = {The increasing pressure of climatic change and anthropogenic activities is predicted to have major effects on ecosystems around the world. With their fragility and sensitivity to hydrologic shifts and land-use changes, wetlands are among the most vulnerable of such ecosystems. Focusing on the Everglades National Park, we here assess the impact of changes in the hydrologic regime, as well as habitat loss, on the spatial configuration of vegetation species. Because the current structuring of vegetation clusters in the Everglades exhibits power-law behavior and such behavior is often associated with self-organization and dynamics occurring near critical transition points, the quantification and prediction of the impact of those changes on the ecosystem is deemed of paramount importance. We implement a robust model able to identify the main hydrologic and local drivers of the vegetation species spatial structuring and apply it for quantitative assessment. We find that shifts in the hydropatterns will mostly affect the relative abundance of species that currently colonize specific hydroperiod niches. Habitat loss or disruption, however, would have a massive impact on all plant communities, which are found to exhibit clear threshold behaviors when a given percentage of habitable habitat is lost.},

abstract = {The availability ofdetailed environmental data, together with inexpensive and powerful computers, has fueled a rapid increase in predictive modeling of species environmental requirements and geographic distributions. For some species, detailed pres- ence/absence occurrence data are available, allowing the use ofa variety ofstandard statistical techniques. However, absence data are not available for most species. In this paper, we introduce the use of the maximum entropy method (Maxent) for modeling species geographic distributions with presence-only data. Maxent is a general-purpose machine learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and it has a number ofaspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modeling. In order to investigate the efficacy ofthe method, here we perform a continental-scale case study using two Neotropical mammals: a lowland species ofsloth, Bradypus variegatus, and a small montane murid rodent, Microryzomys minutus. We compared Maxent predictions with those of a commonly used presence-only modeling method, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). We made predictions on 10 random subsets of the occurrence records for both species, and then used the remaining localities for testing. Both algorithms provided reasonable estimates of the species' range, far superior to the shaded outline maps available in field guides. All models were significantly better than random in both binomial tests ofomission and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was almost always higher for Maxent, indicating better discrimination ofsuitable versus unsuitable areas for the species. The Maxent modeling approach can be used in its present form for many applications with presence-only datasets, and merits further research and development. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The widespread degradation of natural ecosystems requires cost-efficient restoration techniques that minimize risk and consider context-specific restoration conditions. However, meeting these demands can be difficult because information on ecosystem-level factors controlling vegetation and continuous spatial data on species interactions are often lacking. Using airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data from a Hawaiian dry forest, we delineated crowns and assessed the 3D structure of more than 700 000 shrubs and trees. We used Random Forest machine learning to assess the relative importance of resource availability, environmental conditions, and disturbance regimes on canopy density. We then modelled and scaled up plant–plant interactions (i.e. potential nursery effects) to landscape units using a LiDAR-derived Canopy Coalescence (CC) index. We used the relative importance of ecosystem factors, canopy cover, and CC index to prioritize landscapes for restoration. Here, we demonstrate a methodological framework that prioritizes landscapes in need of restoration (i.e. planting woody species) using two ecological perspectives: (i) ecosystem-level controls on remnant woody vegetation, and (ii) potential interactions between established canopies and seedlings (e.g. nursery effect, competition). Our results highlight the heterogeneous nature of ecosystem-level drivers affecting forest structure along elevation gradients. Consequently, the degree of potential nursery interactions between established canopies and seedlings at the landscape-scale was context-specific. Synthesis and applications. Our study provides a methodological approach that prioritizes landscapes for restoration by identifying the main controls on tree spatial distribution and by inferring the favourable conditions for seedlings. This approach can guide land managers to define cost-efficient restoration strategies for large ecological areas.},

abstract = {The impacts of climate and land use changes on streamflow and sediment export were evaluated for a humid (S{\~{a}}o Louren{\c{c}}o) and a dry (Guadalupe) Mediterranean catchment, using the SWAT model. SWAT was able to produce viable streamflow and sediment export simulations for both catchments, which provided a baseline for investigating climate and land use changes under the A1B and B1 emission scenarios for 2071-2100. Compared to the baseline scenario (1971-2000), climate change scenarios showed a decrease in annual rainfall for both catchments (humid: - 12{\%}; dry: - 8{\%}), together with strong increases in rainfall during winter. Land use changes were derived from a socio-economic storyline in which traditional agriculture is replaced by more profitable land uses (i.e. corn and commercial forestry at the humid site; sunflower at the dry site). Climate change projections showed a decrease in streamflow for both catchments, whereas sediment export decreased only for the S{\~{a}}o Louren{\c{c}}o catchment. Land use changes resulted in an increase in streamflow, but the erosive response differed between catchments. The combination of climate and land use change scenarios led to a reduction in streamflow for both catchments, suggesting a domain of the climatic response. As for sediments, contrasting results were observed for the humid (A1B: - 29{\%}; B1: - 22{\%}) and dry catchment (A1B: + 222{\%}; B1: + 5{\%}), which is mainly due to differences in the present-day and forecasted vegetation types. The results highlight the importance of climate-induced land-use change impacts, which could be similar to or more severe than the direct impacts of climate change alone.},

abstract = {Precipitation or rainfall (in tropics) is an important climatic parameter and the studies on rainfall are commonly hampered due to lack of continuous data. To fill the gaps (missing observations) in data, several interpolation techniques are currently used. However, the lack of knowledge on the suitability of these methods for Sri Lanka is a practical problem. In view of this problem, this study is aimed at comparing a few selected methods used for the estimation of missing rainfall data with a new method introduced by the authors to determine their suitability in Sri Lankan context. The methods studied were Arithmetic Mean (Local Mean) method, Normal Ratio method and Inverse Distance method. The new method introduced by the authors is named as Aerial Precipitation Ratio method. In this approach, rain gauging stations where complete monthly rainfall data sets are available were selected in such a way that the selected stations represent each of the seven major Agro-ecological zones of Sri Lanka. This selection procedure of stations makes it possible to generalize the results to the entire country. The period of data ranged from 15 years in the case of mid country intermediate zone to 28 years Up country intermediate zone and Mid country wet zone. Subsequently, monthly rainfall data of each station were estimated using the data of surrounding stations based on the above selected methods so that actual data and the estimated data can be compared. Each estimated series was compared with the actual data series using different statistical comparison techniques. These comparisons include Descriptive Statistics of Error, Root Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Percentage of Error and Correlation Coefficient. Results of the study show that the Inverse Distance method is the most suitable method for all three Low-country zones (wet, intermediate, and dry). However, for Mid-country and Upcountry Intermediate zones, Normal Ratio method is the most suitable method. Further, Arithmetic Mean method is more appropriate for Upcountry Wet zone while Aerial Precipitation Ratio method is more suitable for Mid-country Wet zone. Keywords:},

abstract = {Accurate modeling of geographic distributions of species is crucial to various applications in ecology and conservation. The best performing techniques often require some parameter tuning, which may be prohibitively time-consuming to do separately for each species, or unreliable for small or biased datasets. Additionally, even with the abundance of good quality data, users interested in the application of species models need not have the statistical knowledge required for detailed tuning. In such cases, it is desirable to use ‘‘default settings'', tuned and validated on diverse datasets. Maxent is a recently introduced modeling technique, achieving high predictive accuracy and enjoying several additional attractive properties. The performance of Maxent is influenced by a moderate number of parameters. The first contribution of this paper is the empirical tuning of these parameters. Since many datasets lack information about species absence, we present a tuning method that uses presence-only data. We evaluate our method on independently collected high-quality presence- absence data. In addition to tuning, we introduce several concepts that improve the predictive accuracy and running time of Maxent. We introduce ‘‘hinge features'' that model more complex relationships in the training data; we describe a new logistic output format that gives an estimate of probability of presence; finally we explore ‘‘background sampling'' strategies that cope with sample selection bias and decrease model-building time. Our evaluation, based on a diverse dataset of 226 species from 6 regions, shows: 1) default settings tuned on presence-only data achieve performance which is almost as good as if they had been tuned on the evaluation data itself; 2) hinge features substantially improve model performance; 3) logistic output improves model calibration, so that large differences in output values correspond better to large differences in suitability; 4) ‘‘target-group'' background sampling can give much better predictive performance than random background sampling; 5) random background sampling results in a dramatic decrease in running time, with no decrease in model performance.

Resumen:
Se presenta el modelo Maxent, un modelo que predice la probabilidad de que una especie se encuentre en un punto. En este art{\'{i}}culo se presenta el ajuste emp{\'{i}}rico de los par{\'{a}}metros del modelo y los tipos de funci{\'{o}}n a partir de datos de presencia de las especies; el modelo ajustado se valida con datos de presencia-ausencia, y la configuraci{\'{o}}n resultante es la utilizada por defecto en Maxent. Adem{\'{a}}s, se introducen recientes mejoras del modelo, como las funciones en herradura, el formato de salida log{\'{i}}stico o el muestreo de fondo para eliminar el sesgo en la selecci{\'{o}}n de la muestra.

Teor{\'{i}}a:
Conceptos b{\'{a}}sicos
La distribuci{\'{o}}n verdadera de una especia se representa como una distribuci{\'{o}}n de probabilidad $\pi$ en un conjunto X de ubicaciones. Esta distribuci{\'{o}}n de probabilidad se genera respetando una serie de restricciones observadas en los datos de ocurrencia; de las m{\'{u}}tliples funciones que cumplen estas restricciones, se escoge aquella con mayor entrop{\'{i}}a, es decir, la menos restrictiva.
La distribuci{\'{o}}n de probabilidad $\pi$ pertenece a las distribuciones exponenciales de Gibbs. En ella aparecen una serie de pesos asignados a cada variable explicativa. De las posibles distribuciones de Gibbs, Maxent escoge aqu{\'{e}}lla que maximiza la verosimilitud logar{\'{i}}timica penalizada (verosimilitud logar{\'{i}}tmica - regularizaci{\'{o}}n).
Clases de funciones y variables en Maxent
Seis clases de variables: lineal (L), cuadr{\'{a}}tica (Q), producto (P), umbral (T), bisagra (H) y categ{\'{o}}rica (C). De estas clases se obtienen combinaciones: LC, LQC HC...
Formatos de salida
El formato bruto es el valor de la funci{\'{o}}n exponencial que asgina una probabilidad a cada bicaci{\'{o}}n.
El formato cumulativo se define seg{\'{u}}n las tasas de omisi{\'{o}}n. Es independiente de la escala y m{\'{a}}s f{\'{a}}cilmente interpretable, pero no corresponde necesariamente a la probabilidad de presencia.
El formato log{\'{i}}stico da una estimaci{\'{o}}n de la probabilidad de presencia.
Los tres formatos est{\'{a}}n monot{\'{o}}nicamente relacionados, por lo que ordenan las ubicaciones de igual manera, obteniendo el mismo rendimiento AUC. Sin embargo, no obtienen el mismo rendimiento cuando se analizan los valores predichos, como en la correlaci{\'{o}}n de Pearson.

M{\'{e}}todos:
Datos
Se utilizan dos bases de datos del NCEAS,una de s{\'{o}}lo presencia y otra de presencia y ausencia. Ambas bases de datos contienen informaci{\'{o}}n de 226 especies en 6 regiones del mundo.
Criterios de rendimiento
Log loss: verosimilitud logar{\'{i}}tmica negativa de los datos de prueba.
{\'{A}}rea bajo la curva ROC (AUC): probabilidad de que una presencia aleatoriamente escogida sea ordenada por encima de una ausencia aleatoriamente escogida.
Coeficiente de correlaci{\'{o}}n de Pearson.
Desviaci{\'{o}}n.
Ajuste de par{\'{a}}metros
Se utilizan s{\'{o}}lo datos de presencia, divididos en una muestra de entrenamiento (60{\%}) y una de comprobaci{\'{o}}n (40{\%}). Se hace una validaci{\'{o}}n cruzada de 5 divisiones.
Se ajustan individualmente los par{\'{a}}metros de regularizaci{\'{o}}n ($\beta$) de cauda uno de los tipos de funci{\'{o}}n. Para ello se hace una especie de GridSearch con dos par{\'{a}}metros: el n{\'{u}}mero de ocurrencias y el valor de $\beta$. 
Se estudia el mejor $\beta$ para las variables categ{\'{o}}ricas cuando son empleadas junto con variables continuas.
Se analiza el efecto de tratar variables ordinales discretas como categ{\'{o}}ricas o como continuas.
Se analiza qu{\'{e}} conjuntos de tipos de funciones usar en funci{\'{o}} del n{\'{u}}mero de ocurrencias.
Experimentos con las extensiones de Maxent
Funci{\'{o}}n bisagra: se determina su par{\'{a}}metro de regularizaci{\'{o}}n y el n{\'{u}}mero m{\'{i}}nimo de ocurrencias a partir del cu{\'{a}}l usarlas.
Salida log{\'{i}}stica. Se comparan los tres formatos de salida en funci{\'{o}}n del coef. de correlaci{\'{o}}n.
Sesgo en la selecci{\'{o}}n de la muestra y fondo del grupo objetivo.
Muestreo aleatorio de fondo

Resultados:
Ajuste de par{\'{a}}metros. Clases con m{\'{a}}s variables obtienen par{\'{a}}metros de regularizaci{\'{o}}n con valores mayores. En todas las clases el $\beta$ disminuye conforme aumenta el n{\'{u}}mero de ocurrencias.
Comparaci{\'{o}}n de datos de presencia con presencia-ausencia. El uso de datos de presencia-ausencia mejora ligeramente el AUC.
Extensiones de Maxent
Las funciones de bisagra mejoran el AUC significativamente. Se pueden usar con al menos 15 datos de presencia.
La salida log{\'{i}}stica obtiene mejor correlaci{\'{o}}n que los otros dos formatos.
El uso de fondo del grupo objetivo mejora el AUC respecto al fondo aleatorio. El rendimiento mejora conforme aumenta el n{\'{u}}mero de puntos de fondo hasta los 8000 puntos.

Discusi{\'{o}}n y conclusiones:

abstract = {Quantile mapping bias correction algorithms are commonly used to correct systematic distributional biases in precipitation outputs from climate models. Although they are effective at removing historical biases relative to observations, it has been found that quantile mapping can artificially corrupt future model-projected trends. Previous studies on the modification of precipitation trends by quantile mapping have focused on mean quantities, with less attention paid to extremes. This article investigates the extent to which quantile mapping algorithms modify global climate model (GCM) trends in mean precipitation and precipitation extremes indices. First, a bias correction algorithm, quantile delta mapping (QDM), that explicitly preserves relative changes in precipitation quantiles is presented. QDM is compared on synthetic data with detrended quantile mapping (DQM), which is designed to preserve trends in the mean, and with standard quantile mapping (QM). Next, methods are applied to phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) daily precipitation projections over Canada. Performance is assessed based on precipitation extremes indices and results from a generalized extreme value analysis applied to annual precipitation maxima. QM can inflate the magnitude of relative trends in precipitation extremes with respect to the raw GCM, often substantially, as compared to DQM and especially QDM. The degree of corruption in the GCM trends by QM is particularly large for changes in long period return values. By the 2080s, relative changes in excess of +500{\%} with respect to historical conditions are noted at some locations for 20-yr return values, with maximum changes by DQM and QDM nearing +240{\%} and +140{\%}, respectively, whereas raw GCM changes are never projected to exceed +120{\%}.},

abstract = {Probabilistic predictions from hydrological models, including rainfall-runoff models, provide valuable information for water and environmental resource risk management. However, traditional “deterministic” usage of rainfall-runoff models remains prevalent in practical applications, in many cases because probabilistic predictions are perceived to be difficult to generate. This paper introduces a simplified approach for hydrological model inference and prediction that bridges the practical gap between “deterministic” and “probabilistic” techniques. This approach combines the Least Squares (LS) technique for calibrating hydrological model parameters with a simple method-of-moments (MoM) estimator of error model parameters (here, the variance and lag-1 autocorrelation of residual errors). A case study using two conceptual hydrological models shows that the LS-MoM approach achieves probabilistic predictions with similar predictive performance to classical maximum-likelihood and Bayesian approaches—but is simpler to implement using common hydrological software and has a lower computational cost. A public web-app to help users implement the simplified approach is available.},

abstract = {Hydrometric information constitutes the fundamental input for planning, design, operation, and management of water resources systems. How to optimally site monitoring gauges such that they are effective and efficient in gathering the hydrometric information or data has received considerable attention. This paper presents a generic approach for the design (or evaluation) of hydrometric networks. First, an entropy theory-based criterion, named as maximum information minimum redundancy (MIMR), is proposed. The MIMR criterion maximizes the joint entropy of stations within the optimal set, and the transinformation between stations within and outside of the optimal set. Meanwhile, it insures that the optimal set contains minimum duplicated information. An easy-to-implement greedy ranking algorithm is developed to accomplish the MIMR selection. Two case studies are presented to illustrate the applicability of MIMR in hydrometric network evaluation and design. We also compare the MIMR selection with another entropy-based approach. Results illustrate that MIMR is apt at finding stations with high information content, and locating independent stations. The proposed approach is suitable for design (or evaluation) of any type of hydrometric network.},

Here, several stringent criteria are proposed for automated selection of base flows for this method and are applied to select pure base flows in 26 catchments from the United States, Australia, and China. The characteristic drainage timescale parameter (K) of the linear response function was chosen as the effectiveness measure of the automated method; the K values estimated using this method are 44.5±13.2 days compared with 45.7±10.5 days estimated manually for the catchments with long records. The effects of different imposed criteria on the base flow selection are also quantified using this parameter. The proposed algorithm provides a faster and more objective methodology for automated selection of base flows for recession rate analysis and will thus greatly facilitate its application.},

abstract = {Land change is a cause and consequence of global environmental change1,2. Changes in land use and land cover considerably alter the Earth's energy balance and biogeochemical cycles, which contributes to climate change and—in turn—affects land surface properties and the provision of ecosystem services1–4. However, quantification of global land change is lacking. Here we analyse 35 years' worth of satellite data and provide a comprehensive record of global land-change dynamics during the period 1982–2016. We show that—contrary to the prevailing view that forest area has declined globally5—tree cover has increased by 2.24 million km2 (+7.1{\%} relative to the 1982 level). This overall net gain is the result of a net loss in the tropics being outweighed by a net gain in the extratropics. Global bare ground cover has decreased by 1.16 million km2 (−3.1{\%}), most notably in agricultural regions in Asia. Of all land changes, 60{\%} are associated with direct human activities and 40{\%} with indirect drivers such as climate change. Land-use change exhibits regional dominance, including tropical deforestation and agricultural expansion, temperate reforestation or afforestation, cropland intensification and urbanization. Consistently across all climate domains, montane systems have gained tree cover and many arid and semi-arid ecosystems have lost vegetation cover. The mapped land changes and the driver attributions reflect a human-dominated Earth system. The dataset we developed may be used to improve the modelling of land-use changes, biogeochemical cycles and vegetation–climate interactions to advance our understanding of global environmental change1–4,6.},

abstract = {Uncertainty is an epistemological concept in the sense that any meaningful understanding of uncertainty requires a theory of knowledge. Therefore, uncertainty resulting from scientific endeavors can only be properly understood in the context of a well-defined philosophy of science. Our main message here is that much of the discussion about uncertainty in hydrology has lacked grounding in these foundational concepts, and has resulted in a controversy that is largely the product of logical errors rather than true (axiomatic) disagreement. As an example, we explore the current debate about the appropriate role of probability theory for hydrological uncertainty quantification. Our main messages are: (1) apparent (and/or claimed) limitations of probability theory are not actually consequences of that theory, but rather of deeper underlying epistemological (and ontological) issues; (2) questions about the appropriateness of probability theory are only meaningful if posed as questions about our preferred philosophy of science; and (3) questions about uncertainty may often be better posed as questions about available information and information use efficiency. Our purpose here is to discuss how hydrologists might ask more meaningful questions about uncertainty.},

abstract = {As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, governments and civil society organizations are making large investments in early warning systems (EWS) with the aim to avoid death and destruction from hydro-meteorological events. Early warning systems have four components: (1) risk knowledge, (2) monitoring and warning, (3) warning dissemination and communication, and (4) response capability. While there is room to improve all four of these components, we argue that the largest gaps in early warning systems fall in the latter two categories: warning dissemination/communication and response capability. We illustrate this by examining the four components of early warning systems for the deadliest and costliest meteorological disasters of this century, demonstrating that the lack of EWS protection is not a lack of forecasts or warnings, but rather a lack of adequate communication and lack of response capability. Improving the accuracy of weather forecasts is unlikely to offer major benefits without resolving these gaps in communication and response capability. To protect vulnerable groups around the world, we provide recommendations for investments that would close such gaps, such as improved communication channels, impact forecasts, early action policies and infrastructure. It is our hope that further investment to close these gaps can better deliver on the goal of reducing deaths and damages with EWS.},

abstract = {A physically-based, distributed hydrological model (MIKE SHE) was used to quantify overland runoff in response to four extreme rain events and four types of simulated land use measure in a catchment in Norway. The current land use in the catchment comprises arable lands, forest, urban areas and a stream that passes under a motorway at the catchment outlet. This model simulation study demonstrates how the composition and configuration of land use measures affect discharge at the catchment outlet differently in response to storms of different sizes. For example, clear-cutting on 30{\%} of the catchment area produced a 60{\%} increase in peak discharge and a 10{\%} increase in total runoff resulting from a 50-year storm event in summer, but the effects on peak discharge were less pronounced during smaller storms. Reforestation of 60{\%} of the catchment area was the most effective measure in reducing peak flows for smaller (2-, 5- and 10-year) storms. Introducing grassed waterways reduced water velocity in the stream and resulted in a 28{\%} reduction in peak flow at the catchment outlet for the 50-year storm event. Overall, the results indicate that the specific effect of land use measures on catchment discharge depends on their spatial distribution and on the size and timing of storm events. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Arid and semiarid grasslands of southwestern North America have changed dramatically over the last 150 years as a result of woody plant encroachment. Overgrazing, reduced fire frequency, and climate change are known drivers of woody plant encroachment into grasslands. In this study, relatively simple algorithms for encroachment factors (i.e., grazing, grassland fires, and seed dispersal by grazers) are proposed and implemented in the ecohydrological Cellular-Automata Tree Grass Shrub Simulator (CATGraSS). CATGraSS is used in a 7.3km2 rectangular domain located in central New Mexico along a zone of grassland to shrubland transition, where shrub encroachment is currently active. CATGraSS is calibrated and used to investigate the relative contributions of grazing, fire frequency, seed dispersal by herbivores and climate change on shrub abundance over a 150-year period of historical shrub encroachment. The impact of future climate change is examined using a model output that realistically represents current vegetation cover as initial condition, in a series of stochastic CATGraSS future climate simulations. Model simulations are found to be highly sensitive to the initial distribution of shrub cover. Encroachment factors more actively lead to shrub propagation within the domain when the model starts with randomly distributed individual shrubs. However, when shrubs are naturally evolved into clusters, the model response to encroachment factors is muted unless the effect of seed dispersal by herbivores is amplified. The relative contribution of different drivers on modeled shrub encroachment varied based on the initial shrub cover condition used in the model. When historical weather data is used, CATGraSS predicted loss of shrub and grass cover during the 1950s drought. While future climate change is found to amplify shrub encroachment ({\~{}}13{\%} more shrub cover by 2100), grazing remains the dominant factor promoting shrub encroachment. When we modeled future climate change, however, encroachment still occurred at a reduced rate in the absence of grazing along with pre-grazing fire frequency because of lower shrub water stress leading to reduced shrub mortality which increases the probability of shrub establishment.},

An important question in this context is, how far can widely available hydrologic information (precipitation-temperature-streamflow data and generally available physical descriptors) be used to create a first order grouping of hydrologically similar catchments? We utilize a heterogeneous dataset of 280 catchments located in the Eastern US to understand hydrologic similarity in a 6-dimensional signature space across a region with strong environmental gradients. Signatures are defined as hydrologic response characteristics that provide insight into the hydrologic function of catchments. A Bayesian clustering scheme is used to separate the catchments into 9 homogeneous classes, which enable us to interpret hydrologic similarity with respect to similarity in climatic and landscape attributes across this region. We finally derive several hypotheses regarding controls on individual signatures from the analysis performed here. {\textcopyright} 2011 Author(s).},

This review focuses on how optimal operating rules can be derived and represented. Advantages and draw-backs of each approach are discussed. Major approaches to derive optimal operating rules include direct optimization of reservoir operation, embedding conditional operating rules in simulation-optimization frameworks, and inferring rules from optimization results. Suggestions on which approach to use depend on context. Parametrization–simulation–optimization or rule inference using heuristics are promising approaches.

abstract = {This paper describes the technical development and accuracy assessment of the most recent and improved version of the SoilGrids system at 250 m resolution (June 2016 update). SoilGrids provides global predictions for standard numeric soil properties (organic carbon, bulk density, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), pH, soil texture fractions and coarse fragments) at seven standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm), in addition to predictions of depth to bedrock and distribution of soil classes based on the World Reference Base (WRB) and USDA classification systems (ca. 280 raster layers in total). Predictions were based on ca. 150,000 soil profiles used for training and a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and lithology maps), which were used to fit an ensemble of machine learning methods — random forest and gradient boosting and/or multinomial logistic regression — as implemented in the R packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of 10–fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain between 56 {\%} (coarse fragments) and 83 {\%} (pH) of variation with an overall average of 61 {\%}. Improvements in the relative accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230 {\%}. Improvements can be attributed to the use of machine learning instead of linear regression, to considerable investments in preparing finer resolution covariate layers and to insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial modelling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially hundreds of soil variables. Another area of future research is the development of methods for multiscale merging of SoilGrids predictions with local and/or national gridded soil products (e.g. up to 50 m spatial resolution) so that increasingly more accurate, complete and consistent global soil information can be produced.

abstract = {The Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) is a set of algorithms dedicated to the estimation of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture from satellite data. Ever since its development in 2011, the model has been regularly revised, aiming at the optimal incorporation of new satellite-observed geophysical variables, and improving the representation of physical processes. In this study, the next version of this model (v3) is presented. Key changes relative to the previous version include (1) a revised formulation of the evaporative stress, (2) an optimized drainage algorithm, and (3) a new soil moisture data assimilation system. GLEAM v3 is used to produce three new data sets of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture, including a 36-year data set spanning 1980-2015, referred to as v3a (based on satellite-observed soil moisture, vegetation optical depth and snow-water equivalent, reanalysis air temperature and radiation, and a multi-source precipitation product), and two satellite-based data sets. The latter share most of their forcing, except for the vegetation optical depth and soil moisture, which are based on observations from different passive and active C- and L-band microwave sensors (European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative, ESA CCI) for the v3b data set (spanning 2003-2015) and observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite in the v3c data set (spanning 2011-2015). Here, these three data sets are described in detail, compared against analogous data sets generated using the previous version of GLEAM (v2), and validated against measurements from 91 eddy-covariance towers and 2325 soil moisture sensors across a broad range of ecosystems. Results indicate that the quality of the v3 soil moisture is consistently better than the one from v2: Average correlations against in situ surface soil moisture measurements increase from 0.61 to 0.64 in the case of the v3a data set and the representation of soil moisture in the second layer improves as well, with correlations increasing from 0.47 to 0.53. Similar improvements are observed for the v3b and c data sets. Despite regional differences, the quality of the evaporation fluxes remains overall similar to the one obtained using the previous version of GLEAM, with average correlations against eddy-covariance measurements ranging between 0.78 and 0.81 for the different data sets. These global data sets of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture are now openly available at www.GLEAM.eu and may be used for large-scale hydrological applications, climate studies, or research on land-atmosphere feedbacks.},

In this personal opinion I have concentrated on those processes where soil moisture is the key link between climate fluctuations and vegetation dynamics in space and time. The soil moisture balance equation at a site is shown to be the keystone of numerous fundamental questions which may be instrumental in the quantitative linkage between hydrologic dynamics and ecological patterns and processes. Some of those questions are outlined here, and possible avenues of attack are suggested. The space-time links between climate, soil, and vegetation are also explored from the hydrologic perspective, and some exciting research perspectives are outlined.},

abstract = {The success of hydrological modeling of a high mountain basin depends in most case on the accurate quantification of the snowmelt. However, mathematically modeling snowmelt is not a simple task due to, on one hand, the high number of variables that can be relevant and can change significantly in space and, in the other hand, the low availability of most of them in practical engineering. Therefore, this research proposes to modify the original equation of the classical degree-day model to introduce the spatial and temporal variability of the degree-day factor. To evaluate the effects of the variability in the hydrological modeling and the snowmelt modeling at the cell and hillslope scale. We propose to introduce the spatial and temporal variability of the degree-day factor using maps of radiation indices. These maps consider the position of the sun according to the time of year, solar radiation, insolation, topography and shaded‐relief topography. Our priority has been to keep the parsimony of the snowmelt model that can be implemented in high mountain basins with limited observed input. The snowmelt model was included as a new module in the TETIS distributed hydrological model. The results show significant improvements in hydrological modeling in the spring period when the snowmelt is more important. At cell and hillslope scale errors are diminished in the snowpack, improving the representation of the flows and storages that intervene in high mountain basins.},

abstract = {Drought is a major driver of vegetation activity in Spain, with significant impacts on crop yield, forest growth, and the occurrence of forest fires. Nonetheless, the sensitivity of vegetation to drought conditions differs largely amongst vegetation types and climates. We used a high-resolution (1.1km) spatial dataset of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the whole Spain spanning the period from 1981 to 2015, combined with a another newly developed dataset of the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) to assess the sensitivity of vegetation types to drought across Spain. In specific, this study explores the drought time scales at which vegetation activity shows its highest response to drought severity at different moments of the year. Results demonstrate that {\&}minus; over large areas of Spain {\&}minus; vegetation activity is controlled largely by the interannual variability of drought. More than 90{\%} of the land areas exhibited statistically significant positive correlations between the NDVI and the SPEI during dry summers (JJA). Nevertheless, there are some considerable spatio-temporal variations, which can be linked to differences in land cover and aridity conditions. In comparison to other climatic regions across Spain, results indicate that vegetation types located in arid regions showed the strongest response to drought. Importantly, this study stresses that the time scale at which drought is assessed is a dominant factor in understanding the different responses of vegetation activity to drought.},

abstract = {Modelling hydrology and sediment yield and its scale dependency has been limited by the quantity and quality of instrumental data. This paper aims to apply alternative methods to estimate runoff and sediment production rates at the event-scale and to characterize the hydro-sedimentary response of a highly torrential Mediterranean catchment to historical changes in land use and vegetation. A selection of well-dated and spatially-distributed check dams within the catchment were used to calibrate and validate a hydro-sedimentary distributed model (TETIS). Sediment volumes deposited by individual runoff events and trapped in check dams were estimated on the bases of detailed stratigraphic descriptions and subsequent GPS/TLS surveys. The model results showed a good agreement with the observed water flows and sediment volumes deposited behind several check dams. Management and land uses proved to be a decisive factor in the hydrological behaviour of the catchment, especially affecting erosion and sediment yield. It was observed that while the hydrological response of the catchment was sensitive to the percentage of each land use type, the sedimentary response was more dependent on the spatial distribution of land use. These differences between hydrology and sedimentary behaviour imply that the optimal soil use distribution for soil conservation may differ from the optimal soil use scenario oriented to attenuate flood peaks. This study suggest that soil use policies and erosion mitigation strategies should consider a holistic hydro-sedimentary approach, in order to become an adaptive option to reduce and mitigate the effects of erosion and flood peaks under global change.},

abstract = {Paired catchment studies have been widely used as a means of determining the magnitude of water yield changes resulting from changes in vegetation. This review focuses on the use of paired catchment studies for determining the changes in water yield at various time scales resulting from permanent changes in vegetation. The review considers long term annual changes, adjustment time scales, the seasonal pattern of flows and changes in both annual and seasonal flow duration curves. The paired catchment studies reported in the literature have been divided into four broad categories: afforestation experiments, deforestation experiments, regrowth experiments and forest conversion experiments. Comparisons between paired catchment results and a mean annual water balance model are presented and show good agreement between the two methodologies. The results highlight the potential underestimation of water yield changes if regrowth experiments are used to predict the likely impact of permanent alterations to a catchment's vegetation. An analysis of annual water yield changes from afforestation, deforestation and regrowth experiments demonstrates that the time taken to reach a new equilibrium under permanent land use change varies considerably. Deforestation experiments reach a new equilibrium more quickly than afforestation experiments. The review of papers reporting seasonal changes in water yield highlights the proportionally larger impact on low flows. Flow duration curve comparison provides a potential means of gaining a greater understanding of the impact of vegetation on the distribution of daily flows. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

annote = {Objetivo:
Crear una modelo que describa de forma realista la din{\'{a}}mica de la humedad del suelo como base para el entendimiento de c{\'{o}}mo responde la vegetaci{\'{o}}n ante el estr{\'{e}}s h{\'{i}}drico.

Metodolog{\'{i}}a:
Se describe pormenorizadamente el desarrollo anal{\'{i}}tico del modelo de balance de la humedad del suelo.
El modelo se divide en 2 bloques (ganancias y p{\'{e}}rdidas de humedad).

El bloque de ganancias se compone de:
- Precipitaci{\'{o}}n: se simula mediange un modeo estoc{\'{a}}stico con una proceso de Poisson que establece la ocurrencia de precipitaci{\'{o}}n y una funci{\'{o}}n exponencial que define la magnitud de la lluvia diaria.
- Intercepci{\'{o}}n: se establece un umbral por debajo del cual no hay precipitaci{\'{o}}n efectiva.
- Escorrent{\'{i}}a: se produce cuando la precipitaci{\'{o}}n excede la capacidad de almacenamiento del suelo.

El bloque de p{\'{e}}rdidas se compone de:
- Evapotranspiraci{\'{o}}n: se divide en tres fases: evaporaci{\'{o}}n, ET en condiciones de estr{\'{e}}s h{\'{i}}drico, y ET sin estr{\'{e}}s. Todas ellas son funciones lineales de la humedad, siendo las dos primeras crecientes y la tercera constante.
- Percolaci{\'{o}}n: se simula como una funci{\'{o}}n que reduce exponencialmente la conductividad desde su valor m{\'{a}}ximo de saturaci{\'{o}}n (cuando s=1) hasta cuando se alcanza la capacidad de campo.

Con todo lo anterior se calculan:
- Las funciones de densidad de probabilidad de la humedad del suelo para diversos supuestos de tipo de suelo y profundidad. 
- Los valores medios de los componentes del balance h{\'{i}}drico bajo diversos valores de frecuencia y cantidad de precipitaci{\'{o}}n, y de profundidad del suelo.

Teor{\'{i}}as e hip{\'{o}}tesis:
Modelo de Rodr{\'{i}}guez-Iturbe.
- El modelo es representativo {\'{u}}nicamente para una {\'{e}}poca de crecimiento en la que los par{\'{a}}metros clim{\'{a}}ticos y de la vegetaci{\'{o}}n son constantes.
- La precipitaci{\'{o}}n es tratado como un elemento aleatorio independiente de la humedad del suelo (v{\'{a}}lido para escalas espaciales peque{\~{n}}as).


Resultados:
A partir de las curvas de desnidad de probabilidad:
- Suelos m{\'{a}}s gruesos obtienen pdf desplazadas hacia condiciones m{\'{a}}s secas.
- Suelos someros obtienen pdf m{\'{a}}s anchos.

A partir del balance h{\'{i}}drico:
- La variaci{\'{o}}n de la frecuencia de la precipitaic{\'{o}}n: la escorrent{\'{i}}a es linealmente dependiente; la ET en condiciones de estr{\'{e}}s es m{\'{a}}s sensible que la ET sin estr{\'{e}}s; en climas semi{\'{a}}ridos gran parte de la infiltraci{\'{o}}n se pierde como ET.
- La variaci{\'{o}}n de la profunidad del suelo afecta fuertemente de manera no lineal a todos los componentes (excepto I).
- La variaci{\'{o}}n conjunta de la frecuencia y magnitud de la precipitaci{\'{o}}n permite comprobar que se produce un m{\'{a}}ximo de p{\'{e}}rdidas para valores moderados de frecuencia, lo cual est{\'{a}} directamente relacionado con la productividad del ecosistema

Limitaciones:
- No incluye el movimiento lateral ni vertical del agua.
- Modelo de intercepci{\'{o}}n muy simple.
- Par{\'{a}}metros de evapotranspiraci{\'{o}}n constantes a lo largo de la {\'{e}}poca de crecimiento.
- El modelo de percolaci{\'{o}}n no tiene en cuenta la interacci{\'{o}}n con capas de suelo inferiores.
- El clima se caracteriza por par{\'{a}}metros constantes a lo largo de la {\'{e}}poca de crecimiento.
- Concordancia entre el valor de la humedad del suelo al inicio de la {\'{e}}poca de crecimiento y la asumpci{\'{o}}n de r{\'{e}}gimen estacionario.

Preguntas sin respuesta:


Futura investigaci{\'{o}}n:
Este modelo permite estudiar la influencia de la profundidad activa del suelo, el tipo de suelo, la fisiolog{\'{i}}a de la vegetaci{\'{o}}n y la distribuci{\'{o}}n y cantidad de precipitaci{\'{o}}n en la din{\'{a}}mica de la humedad del suelo.

En este estudio se considera la profundidad del suelo como estable. Para an{\'{a}}lisis a largo plazo sobre evoluci{\'{o}}n de vegetaci{\'{o}}n, se deben de tener en cuenta las variaciones de la porosidad, el envejecimiento del suelo y la profundidad del suelo (p.711)},

abstract = {Large portions of Earth's terrestrial surface are arid or semiarid. As in these regions, the hydrological cycle and the vegetation dynamics are tightly interconnected, a coupled modelling of these two systems is needed to fully reproduce the ecosystem behaviour. In this paper, the performance of two parsimonious dynamic vegetation models, suitable for the inclusion in operational ecohydrological models and based on well-established but different approaches, is compared in a semiarid Aleppo Pine region. The first model [water use efficiency (WUE) model] links growth to transpiration through WUE; the second model [light use efficiency (LUE) model] simulates biomass increase in relation to absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and LUE. Furthermore, an analysis of the information contained in MODIS products is presented to indicate the best vegetation indices to be used as observational verification for the models. Enhanced Vegetation Index is reported in literature to be highly correlated with leaf area index, so it is compared with modelled LAImod (rWUE model = 0.45; rLUE model = 0.57). In contrast, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index appears highly linked to soil moisture, through the control exerted by this variable on chlorophyll production, and is therefore used to analyze LAI*mod, models' output corrected by plant water stress (rWUE model = 0.62; rLUE model = 0.59). Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer Leaf Area Index and evapotranspiration are found to be unrealistic in the studied area. The performance of both models in this semiarid region is found to be reasonable. However, the LUE model presents the advantages of a better performance, the possibility to be used in a wider range of climates and to have been extensively tested in literature.},

abstract = {Summary: In Mediterranean mountainous areas, forests have expanded in recent decades because traditional management practices have been abandoned or reduced. However, understanding the ecological mechanisms behind landscape change is a complex undertaking because the influence of land use may be reinforced or constrained by abiotic factors such as climate. In this work, we evaluated their combined effects on recent forest expansion across climatic, topographic and management gradients. We used orthorectified aerial photographs from the second half of the twentieth century (1956, 1974, 1983, 1990 and 2004) to monitor changes in forest distribution in a set of 20 head-water basins in the Cantabrian Mountains of north-west Spain, at the Eurosiberian-Mediterranean limit. In particular, we evaluated the role of land-use history (comparing natural vs. anthropic basins) and microclimate (comparing shaded vs. sunny aspects) of forest gain/loss rates and spatial distribution shifts. Finally, we applied Species Distribution Modelling techniques (MaxEnt and BIOMOD) in the stated scenarios of land-use history and microclimate, to assess habitat suitability for forest expansion on the basis of topography, soil properties and mesoclimatic variables. Forest cover increased from 10.72{\%} in 1956 to 27.67{\%} in 2004 in the area. The rate of expansion was significantly higher in natural basins and, particularly, on shaded slopes. In all cases, the mean elevation of new forest patches increased during the study period, which was particularly evident on natural sunny slopes. The performance of the models and the magnitude of the effects varied across land-use histories and microclimatic conditions. Soil properties and temperature and precipitation in late spring and early summer were the main drivers of forest expansion in modelling exercises, although expansion rates and upward altitudinal shifts were primarily controlled by land-use history and the biogeographic origin of the forests. Synthesis. The combination of monitoring and modelling techniques used in this work contributed to the understanding of forest expansion in cultural systems, indicating that ecological succession is not a homogeneous process, but varies spatially due to human and abiotic constraints since historical times. {\textcopyright} 2014 British Ecological Society.},

Resumen:
Analiza los cambioes ocurridso durante la segunda mitad del s. XX en la distribuci{\'{o}}n del bosque en 20 cuencas de cabecera del Parque Natura de la Sierra de Ancares. Se analiza el efecto combinado del clima, la topograf{\'{i}}a y el uso hist{\'{o}}rico del suelo.
Adem{\'{a}}s, se aplican Species Distribution Models (SDM) para evaluear la adecuaci{\'{o}}n del territorio para la expansi{\'{o}}n del bosque.

M{\'{e}}todos:
Seguimiento de los cambios en la distribuci{\'{o}}n del bosque
Se digitalizaron 100 mapas de vegetaci{\'{o}}n (20 cuencas y 5 momentos: 1756, 1974, 1983, 1990 y 2004) con ocho categor{\'{i}}as. De estas categor{\'{i}}as s{\'{o}}lo se retuvo bosque caducifolio. 
Sobre los mapas se hizo un estudio de la evoluci{\'{o}}n del {\%} de {\'{a}}rea cubierta con bosques, separando cuencas "naturales" de cuencas "antr{\'{o}}picas" y laderas soleadas de laderas en sombra. Se llevaron a cabo ANOVA en doble sentido para encontrar variaciones significativas.

Factores influyentes en la expansi{\'{o}}n del bosque
58 variables potenciales: 52 mesoclim{\'{a}}ticas a 200 m de resoluci{\'{o}}n (extremos y medios de temperatura y precipitaci{\'{o}}n, CV de la precipitaci{\'{o}}n, amplitud t{\'{e}}rmica), 3 topogr{\'{a}}ficos (altitudo, pendiente y curvatura), y tres propiedades del suelo (materia org{\'{a}}nica, pH y porcentaje de arena). TWI (topographic wetness index)
Se utilizaron correlaciones de Pearson para extraer las nueve variables m{\'{a}}s explicatorias.

Modelado de la distribuci{\'{o}}n
Se aplicaron dos SDM para modelar la expansi{\'{o}}n del bosque en los escenarios de uso hist{\'{o}}rico de suelo (natural-antr{\'{o}}pico) y microclima (soleado-sombra). Los modelos empleados son MaxEnt (maximum enthropy method) y BIOMOD.

Resultados
Seguimiento de los cambios en la distribuci{\'{o}}n del bosque
La cobertura forestal ha pasado del 10.72{\%} en 1956 al 24.1{\%} en 2004. En cuencas naturales los n{\'{u}}meros son del 20.31{\%} al 47.53{\%}; mientras que en cuencas antr{\'{o}}picas del 1.12{\%} al 7.8{\%}. S{\'{o}}lo se aprecian diferencias entre laderas en las {\'{u}}ltimas d{\'{e}}cadas. Los nuevos bosques se ubican siempre a mayor altitud en cuencas naturales y laderas soleadas.

Factores influyentes en la expansi{\'{o}}n del bosque
Los factores m{\'{a}}s relevantes son el suelo y factores clim{\'{a}}ticos (temperatura y precipitaci{\'{o}}n) al final de la primavera y principio del verano.

Modelado de la distribuci{\'{o}}n
MaxEnt obtuvo valores de AUC (area under ROC curve) entre 71 y 91 {\%}, siempre mejores en laderas soleadas que sombr{\'{i}}as, y en cuencas antr{\'{o}}picas. Cuencas naturales y laderas sombr{\'{i}}as tienen m{\'{a}}s susceptibilidad para la expansi{\'{o}}n del bosque que las cuencas antr{\'{o}}picas o las laderas soleadas.

Discusi{\'{o}}n
-La expansi{\'{o}}n del bosque se puede explicar principalmente por factores hist{\'{o}}ricos del uso del suelo.
- La expansi{\'{o}}n del bosque a zonas m{\'{a}}s elevadas puede no tener s{\'{o}}lo con factores clim{\'{a}}ticos, sino con el factor humano u otros factores abi{\'{o}}ticos. En el caso de las laderas soleadas, podr{\'{i}}a ser una adaptaci{\'{o}}n para compensar d{\'{e}}ficit termopluviom{\'{e}}tricos en zonas m{\'{a}}s bajas.
- En cuanto a la topograf{\'{i}}a, zonas de mayor pendiente no son afectadas por el pastoreo ni la agricultura y son m{\'{a}}s susceptibles para la expansi{\'{o}}n del bosque.
- Los factores m{\'{a}}s importantes para la expansi{\'{o}}n del bos que fueron clim{\'{a}}ticos para las cuencas antr{\'{o}}picas, a lo que se a{\~{n}}ade el {\%} de arena en las cuencas naturales.
- Si se cumplen las predicciones de cambio clim{\'{a}}tico, se espera una expansi{\'{o}}n del bosque eurosiberiano en cotas altas, y del bosque mediterr{\'{a}}neo en cotas bajas.},

abstract = {The prediction of water resource evolution is considered to be a major challenge for the coming century, particularly in the context of climate change and increasing demographic pressure. Water resources are directly linked to the continental water cycle, and the main processes modulating changes can be represented by global hydrological models. However, anthropogenic impacts on water resources, and in particular the effects of dams-reservoirs on river flows, are still poorly known and generally neglected in coupled land surface-river routing models. This paper presents a parameterized reservoir model, DROP (Dam-Reservoir OPeration), based on Hanasaki's scheme to compute monthly releases given inflows, water demands and the management purpose. With its significantly anthropized river basins, Spain has been chosen as a study case for which simulated outflows and water storage variations are evaluated against in situ observations over the period 1979-2014. Using a default configuration of the reservoir model, results reveal its positive contribution in representing the seasonal cycle of discharge and storage variation, specifically for large-storage capacity irrigation reservoirs. Based on a bounded version of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) index, called C2M, the overall outflow representation is improved by 43 {\%} in the median. For irrigation reservoirs, the improvement rate reaches 80 {\%}. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis of DROP model parameters was conducted based on the performance of C2M on outflows and volumes using the Sobol method. The results show that the most influential parameter is the threshold coefficient describing the demand-controlled release level. The analysis also reveals the parameters that need to be focused on in order to improve river flow or reservoir water storage modeling by highlighting the difference in the individual effects of the parameters and their interactions depending on whether one focuses on outflows or volume mean seasonal patterns. The results of this generic reservoir scheme show promise for modeling present and future reservoir impacts on the continental hydrology within global land surface-river routing models.},

abstract = {With growing interest in understanding the magnitudes and sources of uncertainty in hydrological modeling, the difficult problem of characterizing model structure adequacy is now attracting considerable attention. Here, we examine this problem via a model-structure-independent approach based in information theory. In particular, we (a) discuss how to assess and compute the information content in multivariate hydrological data, (b) present practical methods for quantifying the uncertainty and shared information in data while accounting for heteroscedasticity, (c) show how these tools can be used to estimate the best achievable predictive performance of a model (for a system given the available data), and (d) show how model adequacy can be characterized in terms of the magnitude and nature of its aleatory uncertainty that cannot be diminished (and is resolvable only up to specification of its density), and its epistemic uncertainty that can, in principle, be suitably resolved by improving the model. An illustrative modeling exam ple is provided using catchment-scale data from three river basins, the Leaf and Chunky River basins in the United States and the Chuzhou basin in China. Our analysis shows that the aleatory uncertainty associated with making catchment simulations using this data set is significant (∼50{\%}). Further, estimated epistemic uncertainties of the HyMod, SAC-SMA, and Xinanjiang model hypotheses indicate that considerable room for model structural improvements remain. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {Google's operational flood forecasting system was developed to provide accurate real-time flood warnings to agencies and the public with a focus on riverine floods in large, gauged rivers. It became operational in 2018 and has since expanded geographically. This forecasting system consists of four subsystems: data validation, stage forecasting, inundation modeling, and alert distribution. Machine learning is used for two of the subsystems. Stage forecasting is modeled with the long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and the linear models. Flood inundation is computed with the thresholding and the manifold models, where the former computes inundation extent and the latter computes both inundation extent and depth. The manifold model, presented here for the first time, provides a machine-learning alternative to hydraulic modeling of flood inundation. When evaluated on historical data, all models achieve sufficiently high-performance metrics for operational use. The LSTM showed higher skills than the linear model, while the thresholding and manifold models achieved similar performance metrics for modeling inundation extent. During the 2021 monsoon season, the flood warning system was operational in India and Bangladesh, covering flood-prone regions around rivers with a total area close to 470 000 km2, home to more than 350 000 000 people. More than 100 000 000 flood alerts were sent to affected populations, to relevant authorities, and to emergency organizations. Current and future work on the system includes extending coverage to additional flood-prone locations and improving modeling capabilities and accuracy.},
annote = {Summary
The article presents the Google Forecasting System (GFS) operational in India and Bangladesh during the 2021 Monsoon season. It compares the performance of differente approaches of streamflow and flood forecasting, and the figures for the 2021 season.

Methods
GFS consists of 4 phases: data digestion, streamflow forecasting, inundation modelling and alert dissemination. The paper focuses mainly of the 2nd and 3rd phase.

Stage forecasting is done in two different ways: a multiple linear regression model and a neural network model (sequense of LSTM and fully connected layers).

Inundation modelling is done in three different ways. The thresholding method is a classification model based on historic river stage and flood extent; it doesn't require DEM, but it doesn't produce a flood depth map. The manifold model is a machi-learning alternative that requires a DEM and it creates both a flood extent and a flood depth map. As a benchmark, they also use a hydraulic model based on the Saint Venant equations.

Results

Stage forecasting
The models are compared in terms of NSE and persistent-NSE (a variant in which instead of the mean discharge it compares against the previous discharge record). A test is done to see if adding precipitation in the input variables adds value.
The metrics are high in any case, but are better for the LSTM model over the MLR and with precipitation data.

Inundation model
The skill is measured in terms of f1-score.
* Thresholding outperforms the hydraulic model and it requires far less computational and manual effort. The hydraulic model was discarded.
* The thresholding model outperforms the manifold model in the majority of the study areas.

Kriging gives good results in 72{\%} of the basins, whereas the second technique gives good results only in 44{\%}. Thus kriging is significantly better. Even if the requirements for 'goodness' are relaxed, a limited number of basins are badly modelled even by kriging.

abstract = {Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are powerful tools to project past, current and future vegetation patterns and associated biogeochemical cycles. However, most models are limited by how they define vegetation and by their simplistic representation of competition. We discuss how concepts from community assembly theory and coexistence theory can help to improve vegetation models. We further present a trait- and individual-based vegetation model (aDGVM2) that allows individual plants to adopt a unique combination of trait values. These traits define how individual plants grow and compete. A genetic optimization algorithm is used to simulate trait inheritance and reproductive isolation between individuals. These model properties allow the assembly of plant communities that are adapted to a site's biotic and abiotic conditions. The aDGVM2 simulates how environmental conditions influence the trait spectra of plant communities; that fire selects for traits that enhance fire protection and reduces trait diversity; and the emergence of life-history strategies that are suggestive of colonization-competition trade-offs. The aDGVM2 deals with functional diversity and competition fundamentally differently from current DGVMs. This approach may yield novel insights as to how vegetation may respond to climate change and we believe it could foster collaborations between functional plant biologists and vegetation modellers.},

Here we show that the distribution of vegetation and basin water stress derived from an algorithm that maintains local optimization within the network flow path exhibits considerably better agreement with the actual distribution than one that ignores the network structure of the basin. These results suggest the pattern of actual vegetation observed within the basin corresponds to a condition of feasible optimality in which organization is constrained by the stochastic nature of local interactions mediated by the network configuration. The principles of such organization have important consequences regarding the interaction between land cover change and hydrological dynamics in river basins, as well as the biogeographical evolution of landscapes.

annote = {Objetivo:
Representar el patr{\'{o}}n de vegetaci{\'{o}}n de la cuenca del R{\'{i}}o Salado a partir de la optimizaci{\'{o}}n factible (feasible optimality) del m{\'{i}}nimo stress h{\'{i}}drico.

Metodolog{\'{i}}a:
- La medida del stress h{\'{i}}drico se hace a trav{\'{e}}s del stress h{\'{i}}drico din{\'{a}}mico modificado ($\theta$').
- La precipitaci{\'{o}}n se simula mediante un proceso marcado de Posion.
- La humedad del suelo se obtiene mediante el modelo de Laio (2000).

- Se generan dos distribuciones iniciales de vegetaci{\'{o}}n: una distribuci{\'{o}}n aleatoria y una una ideal, en la que se asigna a cada punto el tipo de vegetaci{\'{o}}n que minimiza el stress h{\'{i}}drico din{\'{a}}mico modificado.
- A partir de la distribuci{\'{o}}n aleatoria se aplica el principio de "feasible optimality" por medio de aut{\'{o}}matas celulares. En ambos modelos el tipo de vegetaci{\'{o}}n de una celda se intercambia con el de una celda colindante si se supera una probabilidad dependiente del stress h{\'{i}}drico en ambas celdas. En el "modelo vecino" la celda colindante se escoge aleatoriamente; en el "modelo red" corresponde a la celda inmediatamente aguas abajo.

- La comparaci{\'{o}}n de las distribuciones generadas con la distribuci{\'{o}}n real se hace a trav{\'{e}}s de dos representaciones: la funci{\'{o}}n de {\'{a}}rea de $\theta$' y la funci{\'{o}}n de {\'{a}}rea de los {\'{a}}rboles.

Teor{\'{i}}as e hip{\'{o}}tesis:
La distribuci{\'{o}}n de la vegetaci{\'{o}}n en cuencas semi{\'{a}}ridas trata de alcanzar patrones de m{\'{i}}nimo stress h{\'{i}}drico. Sin embargo, el abanico de posibles patrones est{\'{a}} constre{\~{n}}ido a configuraciones sub{\'{o}}ptimas debido a m{\'{i}}nimos locales provocados por la estructura de la red fluvial.

Feasible optimality: limitaci{\'{o}}n de los procesos naturales en su b{\'{u}}squeda de configuraciones {\'{o}}ptimas debido a las constricciones impuestas por las condiciones locales o de contorno. Esta limitaci{\'{o}}n impone que se obtengan configuraciones sub{\'{o}}ptimas.

Resultados:
- El modelo ideal y el modelo vecino optienen id{\'{e}}nticas distribuciones. Esta distribuci{\'{o}}n obtiene valores inferiores del estr{\'{e}}s h{\'{i}}drico en toda la funci{\'{o}}n de {\'{a}}rea y genera err{\'{o}}neamente zonas de la cuenca sin {\'{a}}rboles.
- El modelo red crea una distribuci{\'{o}}n intermedia entre la ideal y la real. Sus funciones de {\'{a}}rea, tanto para el stress h{\'{i}}drico como para los {\'{a}}rboles, se asemejan sensiblemente a las reales.

- Los resultados apoyan la hip{\'{o}}tesis de que en ecosistemas {\'{a}}ridos la red de drenaje act{\'{u}}a como una plantilla para la distribuci{\'{o}}n de vegetaci{\'{o}}n , la cual se autorganiza seg{\'{u}}n m{\'{i}}nimos del stress h{\'{i}}drico.

abstract = {Human activity has produced severe LULC changes within the Upper Citarum watershed and these changes are predicted to continue in the future. With an increase in population parallel to a 141{\%} increment in urban areas, a reduction of rice fields and the replacement of forests with cultivations have been found in the past. Accordingly, LCM model was used to forecast the LULC in 2029. A distributed model called TETIS was implemented in the Upper Citarum watershed to assess the impact of the different historical and future LULC scenarios on its water and sediment cycles. This model was calibrated and validated with different LULCs. For the implementation of the sediment sub-model, it was crucial to use the bathymetric information of the reservoir located at the catchment's outlet. Deforestation and urbanization have been shown to be the most influential factors affecting the alteration of the hydrological and sedimentological processes in the Upper Citarum watershed. The change of LULC decreases evapotranspiration and as a direct consequence, the water yield increased by 15{\%} and 40{\%} during the periods 1994–2014 and 2014–2029, respectively. These increments are caused by the rise of three components in the runoff: overland flow, interflow and base flow. Apart from that, these changes in LULC increased the area of non-tolerable erosion from 412 km2 in 1994 to 499 km2 in 2029. The mean sediment yield increased from 3.1 Mton yr−1 in the 1994 LULC scenario to 6.7 Mton yr−1 in the 2029 LULC scenario. An increment of this magnitude will be catastrophic for the operation of the Saguling Dam.},

abstract = {The concept of causal interactions between components is an integral part of hydrol- ogy and Earth system sciences. Modelers, decision-makers, scientists, and other stake- holders in water resources disciplines all utilize some notion of cause-and-effect in order to understand processes, make decisions and infer how their systems react to change. How- ever, there are different perspectives on the meaning of causality in complex systems, and further, different frameworks and methodologies with which to detect casual inter- actions. Here, we argue that Information Theory (IT) provides a compelling framework for the detection of causality, and discuss approaches for several levels of analyses that capture interactions that range from pairwise to multivariate in nature. We illustrate these types of analyses with an example based on weather station time-series variables, in which variables may interact pairwise or jointly, and on short to long timescales. We further discuss advantages and limitations of these and other IT-based methods in the context of causality detection and their role in process and model dynamics.},

abstract = {We present a European land-only daily high-resolution gridded data set for precipitation and minimum, maximum, and mean surface temperature for the period 1950–2006. This data set improves on previous products in its spatial resolution and extent, time period, number of contributing stations, and attention to finding the most appropriate method for spatial interpolation of daily climate observations. The gridded data are delivered on four spatial resolutions to match the grids used in previous products as well as many of the rotated pole Regional Climate Models (RCMs) currently in use. Each data set has been designed to provide the best estimate of grid box averages rather than point values to enable direct comparison with RCMs. We employ a three-step process of interpolation, by first interpolating the monthly precipitation totals and monthly mean temperature using three-dimensional thin-plate splines, then interpolating the daily anomalies using indicator and universal kriging for precipitation and kriging with an external drift for temperature, then combining the monthly and daily estimates. Interpolation uncertainty is quantified by the provision of daily standard errors for every grid square. The daily uncertainty averaged across the entire region is shown to be largely dependent on the season and number of contributing observations. We examine the effect that interpolation has on the magnitude of the extremes in the observations by calculating areal reduction factors for daily maximum temperature and precipitation events with return periods up to 10 years.},

abstract = {A new global optimization algorithm, dynamically dimensioned search (DDS), is introduced for automatic calibration of watershed simulation models. DDS is designed for calibration problems with many parameters, requires no algorithm parameter tuning, and automatically scales the search to find good solutions within the maximum number of user-specified function (or model) evaluations. As a result, DDS is ideally suited for computationally expensive optimization problems such as distributed watershed model calibration. DDS performance is compared to the shuffled complex evolution (SCE) algorithm for multiple optimization test functions as well as real and synthetic SWAT2000 model automatic calibration formulations. Algorithms are compared for optimization problems ranging from 6 to 30 dimensions, and each problem is solved in 1000 to 10,000 total function evaluations per optimization trial. Results are presented so that future modelers can assess algorithm performance at a computational scale relevant to their modeling case study. In all four of the computationally expensive real SWAT2000 calibration formulations considered here (14, 14, 26, and 30 calibration parameters), results show DDS to be more efficient and effective than SCE. In two cases, DDS requires only 15–20{\%} of the number of model evaluations used by SCE in order to find equally good values of the objective function. Overall, the results also show that DDS rapidly converges to good calibration solutions and easily avoids poor local optima. The simplicity of the DDS algorithm allows for easy recoding and subsequent adoption into any watershed modeling application framework.},

abstract = {Generalized additive, generalized linear, and classi-fication tree models were developed to predict the distribution of 20 species of chaparral and coastal sage shrubs within the southwest ecoregion of California. Mapped explanatory vari-ables included bioclimatic attributes related to primary envi-ronmental regimes: averages of annual precipitation, mini-mum temperature of the coldest month, maximum tempera-ture of the warmest month, and topographically-distributed potential solar insolation of the wettest quarter (winter) and of the growing season (spring). Also tested for significance were slope angle (related to soil depth) and the geographic coordi-nates of each observation. Models were parameterized and evaluated based on species presence/absence data from 906 plots surveyed on National Forest lands. Although all vari-ables were significant in at least one of the species' models, those models based only on the bioclimatic variables predicted species presence with 3 -26 {\%} error. While error would un-doubtedly be greater if the models were evaluated using inde-pendent data, results indicate that these models are useful for predictive mapping – for interpolating species distribution data within the ecoregion. All three methods produced models with similar accuracy for a given species; GAMs were useful for exploring the shape of the response functions, GLMs allowed those response functions to be parameterized and their significance tested, and classification trees, while some-times difficult to interpret, yielded the lowest prediction errors (lower by 3 -5 {\%}).},

@article{Arora2002,
abstract = {Vegetation affects the climate by modifying the energy, momentum, and hydrologic balance of the land surface. Soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) schemes explicitly consider the role of vegetation in affecting water and energy balance by taking into account its physiological properties, in particular, leaf area index (LAI) and stomatal conductance. These two physiological properties are also the basis of evapotranspiration parameterizations in physically based hydrological models. However, most current SVAT schemes and hydrological models do not parameterize vegetation as a dynamic component. The seasonal evolution of LAI is prescribed, and monthly LAI values are kept constant year after year. The effect of CO2 on the structure and physiological properties of vegetation is also neglected, which is likely to be important in transient climate simulations with increasing CO2 concentration and for hydrological models that are used to study climate change impact. The net carbon uptake by vegetation, which is the difference between photosynthesis and respiration, is allocated to leaves, stems, and roots. Carbon allocation to leaves determines their biomass and LAI. The timing of bud burst, leaf senescence, and leaf abscission (i.e., the phenology) determines the length of the growing season. Together, photosynthesis, respiration, allocation, and phenology, which are all strongly dependent on environmental conditions, make vegetation a dynamic component. This paper (1) familiarizes the reader with the basic physical processes associated with the functioning of the terrestrial biosphere using simple nonbiogeochemical terminology, (2) summarizes the range of parameterizations used to model these processes in the current generation of process-based vegetation and plant growth models and discusses their suitability for inclusion in SVAT schemes and hydrological models, and (3) illustrates the manner in which the coupling of vegetation models and SVAT schemes/hydrological models may be accomplished.},

abstract = {Hydrological ensemble prediction systems (HEPS) have in recent years been increasingly used for the operational forecasting of floods by European hydrometeorological agencies. The most obvious advantage of HEPS is that more of the uncertainty in the modelling system can be assessed. In addition, ensemble prediction systems generally have better skill than deterministic systems both in the terms of the mean forecast performance and the potential forecasting of extreme events. Research efforts have so far mostly been devoted to the improvement of the physical and technical aspects of the model systems, such as increased resolution in time and space and better description of physical processes. Developments like these are certainly needed; however, in this paper we argue that there are other areas of HEPS that need urgent attention. This was also the result from a group exercise and a survey conducted to operational forecasters within the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) to identify the top priorities of improvement regarding their own system. They turned out to span a range of areas, the most popular being to include verification of an assessment of past forecast performance, a multi-model approach for hydrological modelling, to increase the forecast skill on the medium range ({\textgreater}3 days) and more focus on education and training on the interpretation of forecasts. In light of limited resources, we suggest a simple model to classify the identified priorities in terms of their cost and complexity to decide in which order to tackle them. This model is then used to create an action plan of short-, medium- and long-term research priorities with the ultimate goal of an optimal improvement of EFAS in particular and to spur the development of operational HEPS in general. {\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s).},

abstract = {Abstract In an introductory review it is reemphasized that the large-scale parameterization of the surface fluxes of sensible and latent heat is properly expressed in terms of energetic considerations over land while formulas of the bulk aerodynamic type are most suitahle over the sea. A general framework is suggested. Data from a number of saturated land sites and open water sites in the absence of advection suggest a widely applicable formula for the relationship between sensible and latent heat fluxes. For drying land surfaces, we assume that the evaporation rate is given by the same formula for evaporation multiplied by a factor. This factor is found to remain at unity while an amount of water, varying from one site to another, is evaporated. Following this a linear decrease sets in, reducing the evaporation rate to zero after a further 5 cm of evaporation, the same at several sites examined.},

abstract = {It is now clear that a large fraction of extreme precipitation and flood events across Western Europe are triggered by Atmospheric Rivers (ARs). The association between ARs and extreme precipitation days over the Iberian Peninsula has been well documented for western river basins. Since ARs are often associated with high impact weather, it is important to study their medium-range predictability. Here we perform such an assessment using the ECMWF ensemble forecasts up to 15 days for events that made landfall in western Iberian Peninsula during the winters spanning between 2012/2013 and 2015/16. IVT and precipitation from the 51 ensemble members of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) ensemble (ENS) were processed over a domain including western Europe and contiguous North Atlantic Ocean. Metrics concerning the ARs location, intensity and orientation were computed, in order to compare the predictive skill (for different prediction lead times) of IVT and precipitation analyses in the IFS. We considered several regional boxes over Western Iberia, where the presence of ARs is detected in analysis/forecasts, enabling the construction of contingency tables and probabilistic evaluation for further objective verification of forecast accuracy. Our results indicate that the ensemble forecasts have skill to detect upcoming ARs events, which can be particularly useful to better predict potential hydrometeorological extremes. We also characterized how the ENS dispersion and confidence curves change with increasing forecast lead times for each sub-domain. The probabilistic evaluation, using ROC analysis, shows that for short lead times precipitation forecasts are more accurate than IVT forecasts, while for longer lead times this reverses ({\~{}}10 days). Furthermore, we show that this reversal occurs for shorter lead times in areas where the ARs contribution is more relevant for winter precipitation totals (e.g. northwestern Iberia).},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} There are millions of river barriers worldwide, ranging from wooden locks to concrete dams, many of which form associated impoundments to store water in small ponds or large reservoirs. Besides their benefits, there is growing recognition of important environmental and social trade-offs related to these artificial structures. However, global datasets describing their characteristics and geographical distribution are often biased towards particular regions or specific applications, such as hydropower dams affecting fish migration, and are thus not globally consistent. Here, we present a new river barrier and reservoir database developed by the Global Dam Watch (GDW) consortium that integrates, harmonizes, and augments existing global datasets to support large-scale analyses. Data curation involved extensive quality control processes to create a single, globally consistent data repository of instream barriers and reservoirs that are co-registered to a digital river network.

abstract = {Land cover monitoring using remotely sensed data requires robust classification methods which allow for the accurate mapping of complex land cover and land use categories. Random forest (RF) is a powerful machine learning classifier that is relatively unknown in land remote sensing and has not been evaluated thoroughly by the remote sensing community compared to more conventional pattern recognition techniques. Key advantages of RF include: their non-parametric nature; high classification accuracy; and capability to determine variable importance. However, the split rules for classification are unknown, therefore RF can be considered to be black box type classifier. RF provides an algorithm for estimating missing values; and flexibility to perform several types of data analysis, including regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning.In this paper, the performance of the RF classifier for land cover classification of a complex area is explored. Evaluation was based on several criteria: mapping accuracy, sensitivity to data set size and noise. Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper data captured in European spring and summer were used with auxiliary variables derived from a digital terrain model to classify 14 different land categories in the south of Spain. Results show that the RF algorithm yields accurate land cover classifications, with 92{\%} overall accuracy and a Kappa index of 0.92. RF is robust to training data reduction and noise because significant differences in kappa values were only observed for data reduction and noise addition values greater than 50 and 20{\%}, respectively. Additionally, variables that RF identified as most important for classifying land cover coincided with expectations. A McNemar test indicates an overall better performance of the random forest model over a single decision tree at the 0.00001 significance level. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {Ensemble flood forecasting has gained significant momentum over the past decade due to the growth of ensemble numerical weather and climate prediction, expansion in high performance computing, growing interest in shifting from deterministic to risk-based decision-making that accounts for forecast uncertainty, and the efforts of communities such as the international Hydrologic Ensemble Prediction Experiment (HEPEX), which focuses on advancing relevant ensemble forecasting capabilities and fostering its adoption. With this shift, comes the need to understand the current state of ensemble flood forecasting, in order to provide insights into current capabilities and areas for improvement, thus identifying future research opportunities to allow for better allocation of research resources. In this article, we provide an overview of current research activities in ensemble flood forecasting and discuss knowledge gaps and future research opportunities, based on a review of 70 papers focusing on various aspects of ensemble flood forecasting around the globe. Future research directions include opportunities to improve technical aspects of ensemble flood forecasting, such as data assimilation techniques and methods to account for more sources of uncertainty, and developing ensemble forecasts for more variables, for example, flood inundation, by applying techniques such as machine learning. Further to this, we conclude that there is a need to not only improve technical aspects of flood forecasting, but also to bridge the gap between scientific research and hydrometeorological model development, and real-world flood management using probabilistic ensemble forecasts, especially through effective communication.

abstract = {Sustainable groundwater development is fundamental in order to provide universal access to safe drinking water. This document, The Code of Practice for Cost Effective Boreholes provides a basis for the realisation of economical and sustainable access to safe water. The term “cost-effective” means optimum value for money invested over the long term. Boreholes are drilled to function for a lifespan of 20 to 50 years. Thus, the lowest cost is not always the most cost-effective, particularly if construction quality is compromised to save money. Cheap drilling or poor construction quality can lead to premature failure of the well or contamination of the water supply. Boreholes that are subsequently abandoned by the users are clearly not cost-effective. The Code of Practice sets out nine principles that relate directly to the practicalities of borehole construction (see below). They should be adhered to in order to provide cost-effective boreholes. Each principle is broken down into sub-principles which recommend procedures to be followed and call for the definition of and adherence to minimum standards. The Code of Practice thus provides a framework to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of existing policies and practices. It is intended to be used as the foundation for the development of national protocols for cost-effective borehole provision. It provides a basis for stakeholders to examine whether they are working in accordance with international practices, and it can be used by donors to examine funding conditionalities.},

abstract = {In high-altitude alpine catchments, diurnal streamflow cycles are typically dominated by snowmelt or ice melt. Evapotranspiration-induced diurnal streamflow cycles are less observed in these catchments but might happen simultaneously. During a field campaign in the summer 2012 in an alpine catchment in the Swiss Alps (Val Ferret catchment, 20.4 km2, glaciarized area: 2{\%}), we observed a transition in the early season from a snowmelt to an evapotranspiration-induced diurnal streamflow cycle in one of two monitored subbasins. The two different cycles were of comparable amplitudes and the transition happened within a time span of several days. In the second monitored subbasin, we observed an ice meltdominated diurnal cycle during the entire season due to the presence of a small glacier. Comparisons between ice melt and evapotranspiration cycles showed that the two processes were happening at the same times of day but with a different sign and a different shape. The amplitude of the ice melt cycle decreased exponentially during the season and was larger than the amplitude of the evapotranspiration cycle which was relatively constant during the season. Our study suggests that an evapotranspirationdominated diurnal streamflow cycle could damp the ice melt-dominated diurnal streamflow cycle. The two types of diurnal streamflow cycles were separated using a method based on the identification of the active riparian area and measurement of evapotranspiration.},

abstract = {The land surface is a key component of climate models. It controls the partitioning of available energy at the surface between sensible and latent heat, and it controls the partitioning of available water between evaporation and runoff. The land surface is also the location of the terrestrial carbon sink. Evidence is increasing that the influence of the land surface is significant on climate and that changes in the land surface can influence regional- to global-scale climate on time scales from days to millennia. Further, there is now a suggestion that the terrestrial carbon sink may decrease as global temperatures increase as a consequence of rising CO2 levels. This paper provides the theoretical background that explains why the land surface should play a central role in climate. It also provides evidence, sourced from climate model experiments, that the land surface is of central importance. This paper then reviews the development of land surface models designed for climate models from the early, very simple models through to recent efforts, which include a coupling of biophysical processes to represent carbon exchange. It is pointed out that significant problems remain to be addressed, including the difficulties in parameterizing hydrological processes, root processes, sub-grid-scale heterogeneity and biogeochemical cycles. It is argued that continued development of land surface models requires more multidisciplinary efforts by scientists with a wide range of skills. However, it is also argued that the framework is now in place within the international community to build and maintain the latest generation of land surface models. Further, there should be considerable optimism that consolidating the recent rapid advances in land surface modelling will enhance our capability to simulate the impacts of land-cover change and the impacts of increasing CO, on the global and regional environment.

abstract = {Numerical approximations on different based forms of the governing partial differential equation can lead to significantly different results for unsaturated flow problems. Numerical solution based on the standard h-based form of Richards equation generally yields poor results, characterized by large mass balance errors and erroneous estimates of infiltration depth. Conversely, numerical solutions based on the mixed form of Richards equation can be shown to possess the conservative property, so that mass is perfectly conserved. This leads to significant improvement in numerical solution performance, while requiring no additional computational effort. However, use of the mass-conservative method does not guarantee good solutions. Accurate solution of the unsaturated flow equation also requires use of a diagonal time (or mass) matrix. Only when diagonal time matrices are used can the solution be shown to obey a maximum principle, which guarantees smooth, nonoscillatory infiltration profiles. This highlights the fact that proper treatment of the time derivative is critical in the numerical solution of unsaturated flow.},

abstract = {An effective description of water transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC) is needed for wide-ranging applications in hydrology and climate-vegetation interactions. In this contribution, the theory of water movement within the SPAC is reviewed with emphasis on the eco-physiological and evolutionary constraints to water transport. The description of the SPAC can be framed at two widely separated time scales: (i) sub-hourly to growing season scales, relevant for hydro-climatic effects on ecosystem fluxes (given a set of plant hydraulic traits), and (ii) inter-annual to centennial scales during which either hydraulic traits may change, as individuals grow and acclimate, or species composition may change. At the shorter time scales, water transport can be described by water balance equations where fluxes depend on the hydraulic features of the different compartments, encoded in the form of conductances that nonlinearly depend on water availability. Over longer time scales, ontogeny, acclimation, and shifts in species composition in response to environmental changes can impose constraints on these equations in the form of tradeoffs and coordinated changes in the hydraulic (and biochemical) parameters. Quantification of this evolutionary coordination and the related tradeoffs offers novel theoretical tactics to constrain hydrologic and biogeochemical models. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Stream flow analysis was conducted using four base flow separation methods for a quaternary catchment with drainage area of 92,682 ha, which is the origin of the Modder River. These methods are: the Nathan and McMahon (N{\&}M) method, the Chapman method, the Smakhtin and Watkins method (S{\&}W), and the frequency duration analysis. All the methods gave higher percentage of the low flow component (base flow), except for the S{\&}W method which underestimated it. The N{\&}M filtering equation gave base flow components greater than 66{\%} in 1999 and increased to 84{\%} in 2007 while the Chapman equation gave 65{\%} and 74{\%} in 1999 and 2007, respectively. Similarly, the frequency duration analysis gave 62{\%} in 1999 and increased to 79{\%} in 2007. The frequency duration analysis gave up to 13{\%} lower than the N{\&}M filtering equation. The nine year base flow averages were 69{\%}, 69{\%}, 75{\%} and 43{\%} for frequency duration analysis, Chapman, N{\&}M and S{\&}W filtering equations, respectively. The result showed that the Modder River is largely supplied by the ground water discharge. The result seemed to concur with the fact that for a semi-arid catchment such as the Modder river basin, with an average annual runoff coefficient of approximately 6{\%}, the contribution of annual rainfall to direct runoff seems to be minimal.},

annote = {Objetivo:
Se expone la necesidad de modificar el paradigma de la calibraci{\'{o}}n de los modelos hidrol{\'{o}}gicos. 
- Puesto que no es posible generar un {\'{u}}nico mejor conjunto de par{\'{a}}metros, se debe tener en cuenta dicha incertidumbre a trav{\'{e}}s de la generaci{\'{o}}n de conjuntos de par{\'{a}}metros {\'{o}}ptimos (Pareto set). 
- Los modelos hidrol{\'{o}}gicos con varias magnitudes de salida requieren algoritmos de calibraci{\'{o}}n multiobjetivo.

Teor{\'{i}}as e hip{\'{o}}tesis:
Punto de vista multiobjetivo:
Puesto que no se ha podido identificar cu{\'{a}}l de las funciones objetivo tradicionalmente usadas es la "mejor", es necesario pensar en optimizar varias funciones objetivo simult{\'{a}}neamente. Esto supone que no se pueda obtener un {\'{u}}nico set de par{\'{a}}metros, sino que se obtengan varios conjuntos de par{\'{a}}metros {\'{o}}ptimos (pareto optimal). Este conjunto de Pareto engloba los sets de par{\'{a}}metros buenos, entre los cuales no se puede escoger uno como estrictamente mejor.

M{\'{u}}ltiples variables de salida:

Optimizaci{\'{o}}n multiobjetivo efectiva y eficiente:
Se muestran algunos algoritmos de optimizaci{\'{o}}n multiobjetivo (m{\'{e}}todo de los pesos) y su limitaci{\'{o}}n de uso debido al alto coste computacional. Como alternativa, se presenta el algoritmo multiobjective complex evolution (MOCOM-UA), una evoluci{\'{o}}n del SCE-UA que obtiene eficientemente el set de Pareto y no require de coef. de ponderaci{\'{o}}n subjetivos.

Selecci{\'{o}}n de funciones objetivo:
Es una selecci{\'{o}}n subjetiva en funci{\'{o}}n del contexto del estudio.

Metodolog{\'{i}}a:
Caso de estudio en Leaf River (Mississippi):
Se claibra bajo la hip{\'{o}}tesis de que es posible obtener sets de par{\'{a}}metros que optimicen la desviaci{\'{o}}n de los residuos, el sesgo y la "blancura" de residuos.
Como algoritmo de calibraci{\'{o}}n se utiliza el MOCOM-UA.
Los resultados de la calibraci{\'{o}}n se utilizan para predecir caudales.

Resultados:
- MOCOM-UA es un algoritmo altamente eficiente en comparaci{\'{o}}n con SCEA-UA.
- El conjunto de par{\'{a}}metros de Pareto se reduce notablemente con respecto al rango de incertidumbre. La amplitud del rango {\'{o}}ptimo de cada par{\'{a}}metro permite entender y mejorar el modelo.
- El modelo calibrado es capaz de predecir satisfactoriamente los caudales altos y medios, pero no la recesi{\'{o}}n del hidrograma y los caudales bajos. Este an{\'{a}}lisis permite conocer las limitaciones del modelo.

Limitaciones:
No se ha tenido en cuenta el estudio de los posibles errores en los datos de entrada.

Preguntas sin respuesta:


Futura investigaci{\'{o}}n:
- Definir qu{\'{e}} funciones objetivo son las m{\'{a}}s adecuadas.
- Sensibilidad de los resultados frente a la cantidad de datos disponibles.
- Ampliar la investigaci{\'{o}}n a las incertidumbres estoc{\'{a}}sticas de las mediciones.},

abstract = {Hydrological forecasts with a high temporal and spatial resolution are required to provide the level of information needed by end users. So far high-resolution multimodel seasonal hydrological forecasts have been unavailable due to 1) lack of availability of high-resolution meteorological seasonal forecasts, requiring temporal and spatial downscaling; 2) a mismatch between the provided seasonal forecast information and the user needs; and 3) lack of consistency between the hydrological model outputs to generate multimodel seasonal hydrological forecasts. As part of the End-to-End Demonstrator for Improved Decision Making in the Water Sector in Europe (EDgE) project commissioned by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (ECMWF), this study provides a unique dataset of seasonal hydrological forecasts derived from four general circulation models [CanCM4, GFDL Forecast-Oriented Low Ocean Resolution version of CM2.5 (GFDL-FLOR), ECMWF Season Forecast System 4 (ECMWF-S4), and M{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}o-France LFPW] in combination with four hydrological models [mesoscale hydrologic model (mHM), Noah-MP, PCRaster Global Water Balance (PCR-GLOBWB), and VIC]. The forecasts are provided at daily resolution, 6-month lead time, and 5-km spatial resolution over the historical period from 1993 to 2012. Consistency in hydrological model parameterization ensures an increased consistency in the hydrological forecasts. Results show that skillful discharge forecasts can be made throughout Europe up to 3 months in advance, with predictability up to 6 months for northern Europe resulting from the improved predictability of the spring snowmelt. The new system provides an unprecedented ensemble of seasonal hydrological forecasts with significant skill over Europe to support water management. This study highlights the potential advantages of multimodel based forecasting system in providing skillful hydrological forecasts.},

abstract = {Regionalization methods are often used in hydrology for regional trend analysis and frequency analysis of floods, low flows and other variables. During the last two decades considerable effort has gone into analysis and development of regionalization procedures. However, as no single procedure has been demonstrated to yield universally acceptable results, several methods of regionalization are in use. In this paper, three hybrid-clustering algorithms, which use partitional clustering procedure to identify groups of similar catchments by refining the clusters derived from agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms, are investigated to determine their effectiveness in regionalization. The hierarchical clustering algorithms used are single linkage, complete linkage and Ward's algorithms, while the partitional clustering algorithm used is the K-means algorithm. The effectiveness of the hybrid-cluster analysis in regionalization is investigated by using data from watersheds in Indiana, USA. Further, four cluster validity indices, namely cophenetic correlation coefficient, average silhouette width, Dunn's index and Davies-Bouldin index are tested to determine their effectiveness in identifying optimal partition provided by the clustering algorithms. The regions given by the clustering algorithms are, in general, not statistically homogeneous. The hybrid-cluster analysis is found to be useful in minimizing the effort needed to identify homogeneous regions. The hybrid of Ward's and K-means algorithms is recommended for use. The hybrid method provides enough flexibility and it offers prospects for improvement in regionalization studies. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Current global river routing models do not represent floodplain inundation dynamics realistically because the storage and movement of surface waters are regulated by small-scale topography rather than the commonly used spatial resolution of global models. In this study, we propose a new global river routing model, CaMa-Flood, which explicitly parameterizes the subgrid-scale topography of a floodplain, thus describing floodplain inundation dynamics. The relationship between water storage, water level, and flooded area in the model is decided on the basis of the subgrid-scale topographic parameters based on 1 km resolution digital elevation model. Horizontal water transport is calculated with a diffusive wave equation, which realizes the backwater effect in flat river basins. A set of global-scale river flow simulations demonstrated an improved predictability of daily-scale river discharge in many major world rivers by incorporating the floodplain inundation dynamics. Detailed analysis of the simulated results for the Amazon River suggested that introduction of the diffusive wave equation is essential for simulating water surface elevation realistically. The simulated spatiotemporal variation of the flooded area in the Amazon basin showed a good correlation with satellite observations, especially when the backwater effect was considered. The improved predictability for daily river discharge, water surface elevation, and inundated areas by the proposed model will promote climate system studies and water resource assessments.

abstract = {Multi-objective hydrological model calibration can represent a valuable solution to reduce model equifinality and parameter uncertainty. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model is widely applied to investigate water quality and water management issues in alpine catchments. However, the model calibration is generally based on discharge records only, and most of the previous studies have defined a unique set of snow parameters for an entire basin. Only a few studies have considered snow observations to validate model results or have taken into account the possible variability of snow parameters for different subbasins. This work presents and compares three possible calibration approaches. The first two procedures are single-objective calibration procedures, for which all parameters of the SWAT model were calibrated according to river discharge alone. Procedures I and II differ from each other by the assumption used to define snow parameters: The first approach assigned a unique set of snow parameters to the entire basin, whereas the second approach assigned different subbasin-specific sets of snow parameters to each subbasin. The third procedure is a multi-objective calibration, in which we considered snow water equivalent (SWE) information at two different spatial scales (i.e. subbasin and elevation band), in addition to discharge measurements. We tested these approaches in the Upper Adige river basin where a dense network of snow depth measurement stations is available. Only the set of parameters obtained with this multi-objective procedure provided an acceptable prediction of both river discharge and SWE. These findings offer the large community of SWAT users a strategy to improve SWAT modeling in alpine catchments.},

abstract = {Reservoirs significantly affect flow regimes in watershed systems by changing the magnitude and timing of streamflows. Failure to represent these effects limits the performance of hydrological and land-surface models (H-LSMs) in the many highly regulated basins across the globe and limits the applicability of such models to investigate the futures of watershed systems through scenario analysis (e.g., scenarios of climate, land use, or reservoir regulation changes). An adequate representation of reservoirs and their operation in an H-LSM is therefore essential for a realistic representation of the downstream flow regime. In this paper, we present a general parametric reservoir operation model based on piecewise-linear relationships between reservoir storage, inflow, and release to approximate actual reservoir operations. For the identification of the model parameters, we propose two strategies: (a) a "generalized" parameterization that requires a relatively limited amount of data and (b) direct calibration via multi-objective optimization when more data on historical storage and release are available. We use data from 37 reservoir case studies located in several regions across the globe for developing and testing the model. We further build this reservoir operation model into the MESH (Mod{\'{e}}lisation Environmentale-Surface et Hydrologie) modeling system, which is a large-scale H-LSM. Our results across the case studies show that the proposed reservoir model with both parameter-identification strategies leads to improved simulation accuracy compared with the other widely used approaches for reservoir operation simulation. We further show the significance of enabling MESH with this reservoir model and discuss the interdependent effects of the simulation accuracy of natural processes and that of reservoir operations on the overall model performance. The reservoir operation model is generic and can be integrated into any H-LSM.},

abstract = {The Penman-Monteith (PM) equation is commonly considered the most advanced physically based approach to computing transpiration rates from plants considering stomatal conductance and atmospheric drivers. It has been widely evaluated at the canopy scale, where aerodynamic and canopy resistance to water vapour are difficult to estimate directly, leading to various empirical corrections when scaling from leaf to canopy. Here, we evaluated the PM equation directly at the leaf scale, using a detailed leaf energy balance model and direct measurements in a controlled, insulated wind tunnel using artificial leaves with fixed and predefined stomatal conductance. Experimental results were consistent with a detailed leaf energy balance model; however, the results revealed systematic deviations from PM-predicted fluxes, which pointed to fundamental problems with the PM equation. Detailed analysis of the derivation by Monteith(1965) and subsequent amendments revealed two errors: one in neglecting two-sided exchange of sensible heat by a planar leaf, and the other related to the representation of hypostomatous leaves, which are very common in temperate climates. The omission of two-sided sensible heat flux led to bias in simulated latent heat flux by the PM equation, which was as high as 50{\%} of the observed flux in some experiments. Furthermore, we found that the neglect of feedbacks between leaf temperature and radiative energy exchange can lead to additional bias in both latent and sensible heat fluxes. A corrected set of analytical solutions for leaf temperature as well as latent and sensible heat flux is presented, and comparison with the original PM equation indicates a major improvement in reproducing experimental results at the leaf scale. The errors in the original PM equation and its failure to reproduce experimental results at the leaf scale (for which it was originally derived) propagate into inaccurate sensitivities of transpiration and sensible heat fluxes to changes in atmospheric conditions, such as those associated with climate change (even with reasonable present-day performance after calibration). The new formulation presented here rectifies some of the shortcomings of the PM equation and could provide a more robust starting point for canopy representation and climate change studies.},

abstract = {Conceptual hydrological modelling has traditionally been plagued by calibration difficulties due to the roughness and complex shape of objective functions. These problems led to the abandonment of powerful classical analysis methods (Newton-type optimisation, derivative-based uncertainty analysis) and have motivated extensive research into nonsmooth optimisation and even new parameter estimation philosophies (e.g. GLUE). This paper shows that some of these complexities are not inherent features of hydrological models, but are numerical artefacts due to model thresholds and poorly selected time stepping schemes. We present a numerically robust methodology for implementing conceptual models, including rainfall-runoff and snow models, that ensures micro-scale smoothness of objective functions and guarantees macro-scale model stability. The methodology employs robust and unconditionally stable time integration of the models, complemented by careful threshold smoothing. A case study demonstrates the benefits of these techniques. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The PCRaster Spatial Modelling language is a GIS capable of dynamic modelling. It has been extended recently with a kinematic wave approximation simulation tool to allow for physically based water flow modelling. The LISFLOOD model is an example of a physically based model written using the PCRaster GIS environment. The LISFLOOD model simulates river discharge in a drainage basin as a function of spatial data on topography, soils and land cover. Although hydrological modelling capabilities have largely increased, there is still a need for development of other routing methods, such a diffusion wave.

In these ecosystems, biomass and soil moisture are cou-pled stochastic variables externally driven, mainly, by the rainfall dynamics. Based on long-term field observations in northwestern (NW) China, we test a recently developed analytical scheme for the description of the leaf biomass dynamics undergoing seasonal cycles with different rainfall characteristics. The probabilistic char-acterization of such dynamics agrees remarkably well with the field measurements, providing a tool to forecast the changes to be expected in biomass for arid and semiarid ecosystems under climate change conditions. These changes will depend—for each season—on the forecasted rate of rainy days, mean depth of rain in a rainy day, and duration of the season. For the site in NW China, the current scenario of an increase of 10{\%} in rate of rainy days, 10{\%} in mean rain depth in a rainy day, and no change in the season duration leads to forecasted increases in mean leaf biomass near 25{\%} in both seasons. ecohydrology | stochastic dynamics | vegetation modeling | climate change impacts | soil moisture},

abstract = {In the field of hydrological prediction for medium-sized watersheds, characterized by complex orography and short response times, forecasts cannot rely only upon observed precipitation: predicted rainfall is in this case an essential input for hydrological models. However, the quality and reliability of deterministic numerical precipitation forecasts driving a hydrological model are often unsatisfactory, because uncertainty in Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts (QPFs) is considerable at the scales of interest for hydrological purposes. The uncertainty inherent in precipitation forecast can be accounted for better estimating the uncertainty associated with the flood forecast, in order to provide a more informative hydrological prediction. The methodology proposed and adopted in this work is based on a hydrological ensemble forecasting approach that uses multiple precipitation scenarios provided by different high-resolution numerical weather prediction models, driving the same hydrological model. In this way, the uncertainty associated with the meteorological forecasts can propagate into the hydrological models and be used in warnings and decision making procedures relying upon a probabilistic approach. In the framework of RISK AWARE, an INTERREG III B EU project, a detailed analysis of two cases of intense precipitation affecting the Reno river basin, a medium-sized catchment in northern Italy, has been performed. One case study has been performed using lateral boundary values derived from analysed fields, the other simulating a real time forecast, i.e., using forecasted boundary conditions. Four different meteorological models (Lokal Modell, RAMS, BOLAM and MOLOCH), operating at different horizontal resolutions, provide QPFs which are used to force the hydrological model. The discharge predictions are obtained by means of the physically based rainfall-runoff model TOPKAPI. The results provide examples of the uncertainties inherent in the QPF and show that the hydrological response of the Reno river basin, as simulated by the TOPKAPI model, is highly sensitive to the correct space-time localization of precipitation, even if the total amount of rainfall is, on average, well forecasted. The system seems able to provide useful information concerning the discharge peaks (amount and timing) for warning purposes. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2008.},

(Water Resources Research 1980; 16(5): 855-862), which recognized that a treatment of water discharges with 'travel times' could provide a rich interpretation of the theory of the instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH). We show how this was possible, what assumptions were made, which of these assumptions can be relaxed, and which have become obsolete and been discarded. The second section focuses on the width-function-based IUH (WFIUH) approach and its achievements in assessing the interplay of the topology and geometry of the network with water dynamics. The limitations of the WFIUH approach are described, and a way to work around them is suggested.

abstract = {In this study we develop and test a calibration approach on a spatially distributed groundwater–surface water catchment model (MIKE SHE) coupled to a land surface model component with particular focus on the water and energy fluxes. The model is calibrated against time series of eddy flux measurements from three sites of different land surface type (agriculture, forest and meadow) and river discharge data from the 2500km2 Skjern River catchment in Denmark. The approach includes initial calibrations of three one-dimensional models representing the three land surface types using the flux measurements for calibration. This step provides initial values for the subsequent modelling and calibration at catchment scale. To test the validity of the approach, two additional catchment scale distributed simulations were performed with no calibration and only calibration of the one-dimensional models, respectively. In addition, a subsequent validation period was simulated. A mean energy closure imbalance of 20{\%} was seen for the three sites. For the distributed simulations, the energy imbalance was accounted for by two energy balance closure hypotheses ascribing the error to either energy fluxes or net radiation. In general, the distributed calibration approach improved model results substantially compared to using default values (no calibration) or calibration of the one-dimensional models only. For the distributed model simulations, the assumption regarding the energy balance closure had a substantial impact on the parameter sensitivities and on the simulated discharge and energy balance. During calibration, the simulation with corrected energy fluxes showed better performance on discharge than the simulation with corrected net radiation whereas the reverse was true for the validation period. Regarding energy fluxes, the simulation with corrected net radiation was superior in both the calibration and validation period.},

abstract = {Estimating spatially distributed parameters remains one of the biggest challenges for large-domain hydrologic modeling. Many large-domain modeling efforts rely on spatially inconsistent parameter fields, e.g., patchwork patterns resulting from individual basin calibrations, parameter fields generated through default transfer functions that relate geophysical attributes to model parameters, or spatially constant, default parameter values. This paper provides an initial assessment of a multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR) method over large geographical domains to derive seamless parameters in a spatially consistent manner. MPR applies transfer functions at the native scale of the geophysical data, and then scales these model parameters to the desired model resolution. We developed a stand-alone framework called MPR-flex for multimodel use and applied MPR-flex to the variable infiltration capacity model to produce hydrologic simulations over the contiguous United States (CONUS). We first independently calibrate 531 basins across CONUS to obtain a performance benchmark for each basin. To derive the CONUS parameter fields, we perform a joint MPR calibration using all but the poorest behaved basins to obtain a single set of transfer function parameters that are applied to the entire CONUS. Results show that CONUS-wide calibration has similar performance compared to previous simulations using a patchwork quilt of partially calibrated parameter sets, but without the spatial discontinuities in parameters that characterize some previous CONUS-domain model simulations. Several avenues to improve CONUS-wide calibration remain, including selection of calibration basins, objective function formulation, as well as MPR-flex improvements including transfer function formulations and scaling operator optimization.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract. Globally there are over 24,000 storage structures (e.g. dams and reservoirs) that contribute over 7,000 km3 of storage. Until recently, most of the data regarding these reservoirs was not openly accessible. As a result, many studies rely on generalized operations based on generalized assumptions about reservoir storage dynamics and management. With the creation of global datasets such as the Global Reservoirs and Dams (GRanD), RealSat, GloLakes, and the International Coalition for Large Dams database (iCOLD) as well as localized datasets such as ResOpsUS for the contiguous United States, and the Mekong Data Monitor for the Mekong River basin, the inference of reservoir operations using data derived techniques has become much more ubiquitous regionally. Yet to our knowledge, there has been no global application of data-derived methods due to their model complexities and data limitations. Therefore, our analysis aims to fill this gap by providing a workflow for implementing data derived reservoir operations in the large scale hydrologic models with an application in the PCRGLOBWB 2 global hydrologic model. This methodology uses global satellite altimetry data from GloLakes, a parameterization methodology developed by Turner et al. (2021), and a random forest model. We also test the sensitivity of our reservoir scheme to downstream demand by selecting three different downstream areas presumed to be served by reservoirs release (command areas): 250 km, 650 km, and 1100 km. Our results demonstrate that our random forest algorithm is able to capture the storage dynamics and that the errors are mainly due to the errors in using remotely sensed storage data. Additionally, we observe in many cases that deriving operational bounds from historical reservoir time series has minimal impact on streamflow at the basin outlets nor is the scheme sensitive to the downstream command areas. We do observe that streamflow is affected directly downstream from the reservoirs and that the data-derived methodology does increase the accuracy of simulated global reservoir storage when compared to observations. In fact, the derived operations have much lower storage values that align better with both direct and remotely sensed reservoir storage observations. This demonstrates that generic operations overestimate the total amount of water stored in reservoirs and, as a result, are potentially overestimating water availability. Ultimately, our workflow allows global hydrologic models to capitalize on recent data acquisition by remote sensing to provide more accurate reservoir storage and global water security.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {A conceptual rainfall-runoff model was applied to 95 catchments in the Rhine basin for the purpose of modeling of the effect of land use change on the runoff. An approach to calibrate the model by associating the model parameters with the physical catchment characteristics was implemented. Land use, soil type, catchment size, and topographic structure were used as the bases for regionalization of the model parameters. Parameter values were initially associated with these catchment characteristics and were finally transferred into their catchment scale values using a transfer function, whose form was assumed a priori. A simultaneous model calibration was performed for a number of catchments with contrasting catchment characteristics. An optimization algorithm was used for the calibration with an objective function defined as the normalized sum of the squared differences between the modeled and the observed runoff. The regionalized model thus obtained was then used to model the resulting runoff for different land use scenarios generated in the model area. The results obtained suggest that increased urbanization leads to an increase in the lower peak runoff resulting from summer storm, while the increase in the higher peaks resulting from winter rainfall is very little. On the other hand, a considerable reduction of both the peak runoff and the total runoff volume resulted from intensified afforestation. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In climate research it is important to have access to reliable data which are free from artificial trends or changes. One way of checking the reliability of a climate series is to compare it with surrounding stations. This is the idea behind all tests of the relative homogeneity. Here we will present a simple homogeneity test and apply it to a precipitation data set from south‐western Sweden. More precisely we will apply it to ratios between station values and some reference values. The reference value is a form of a mean value from surrounding stations. It is found valuable to include short and incomplete series in the reference value. The test can be used as an instrument for quality control as far as the mean level of, for instance, precipitation is concerned. In practice it should be used along with the available station history. Several non‐homogeneities are present in these series and probably reflect a serious source of uncertainty in studies of climatic trends and climatic change all over the world. The significant breaks varied from 5 to 25 per cent for this data set. An example illustrates the importance of using relevant climatic normals that refer to the present measurement conditions in constructing maps of anomalies.

abstract = {A framework is provided for scaling and scale issues in hydrology. The first section gives some basic definitions. This is important as researchers do not seem to have agreed on the meaning of concepts such as scale or upscaling. ‘Process scale', ‘observation scale' and ‘modelling (working) scale' require different definitions. The second section discusses heterogeneity and variability in catchments and touches on the implications of randomness and organization for scaling. The third section addresses the linkages across scales from a modelling point of view. It is argued that upscaling typically consists of two steps: distributing and aggregating. Conversely, downscaling involves disaggregation and singling out. Different approaches are discussed for linking state variables, parameters, inputs and conceptualizations across scales. This section also deals with distributed parameter models, which are one way of linking conceptualizations across scales. The fourth section addresses the linkages across scales from a more holistic perspective dealing with dimensional analysis and similarity concepts. The main difference to the modelling point of view is that dimensional analysis and similarity concepts deal with complex processes in a much simpler fashion. Examples of dimensional analysis, similarity analysis and functional normalization in catchment hydrology are given. This section also briefly discusses fractals, which are a popular tool for quantifying variability across scales. The fifth section focuses on one particular aspect of this holistic view, discussing stream network analysis. The paper concludes with identifying key issues and gives some directions for future research.},

The dataset is available at 8-day and monthly temporal resolutions.

Independent assessment of VIIRS reservoir storage (8-day) retrievals against in-situ measurements shows an average of R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 0.47 km3, and NRMSE = 16.45{\%}. The evaporation rate has an average of R2 = 0.56, RMSE = 1.32 mm/day, and NRMSE = 28.14{\%}. Furthermore, results show good consistency (R2 ≥ 0.90) between the VIIRS and MODIS-based product components, confirming that long-term data continuity can be achieved.

abstract = {To address certain limitations with their current operational model, Environment and Climate Change Canada recently developed the Soil, Vegetation, and Snow (SVS) land surface model and the representation of subsurface hydrological processes was targeted as an area for improvement. The objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of HydroSVS, the component of SVS responsible for the vertical redistribution of water, to simulate soil moisture under snow-free conditions when using flux-tower observations of evapotranspiration as forcing data. We assessed (1) model fidelity by comparing soil moisture modelled with HydroSVS to point-scale measurements of volumetric soil water content and (2) model complexity by comparing the performance of HydroSVS to that of HydroGeoSphere, a state-of-the-art integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model. To do this, we performed one-dimensional soil column simulations at four sites of the AmeriFlux network. Results indicate that under Mediterranean and temperate climates, HydroSVS satisfactorily simulated soil moisture (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency between 0.26 and 0.70; R2≥ 0.80), with a performance comparable to HydroGeoSphere (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ≥0.60; R2≥ 0.80). However, HydroSVS performed weakly under a semiarid climate while HydroGeoSphere performed relatively well. By decoupling the magnitude and sourcing of evapotranspiration, this study proposes a powerful diagnostic tool to evaluate the representation of subsurface hydrological processes in land surface models. Overall, this study highlights the potential of SVS for hydrological applications.},

abstract = {This paper examines the linkage between the drainage network and the patterns of soil water balance components determined by the organization of vegetation, soils and climate in a semiarid river basin. Research during the last 10 years has conclusively shown an increasing degree of organization and unifying principles behind the structure of the drainage network and the three-dimensional geometry of river basins. This cohesion exists despite the infinite variety of shapes and forms one observes in natural watersheds. What has been relatively unexplored in a quantitative and general manner is the question of whether or not the interaction of vegetation, soils, and climate also display a similar set of unifying characteristics among the very different patterns they presents in river basins. A recently formulated framework for the water balance at the daily level links the observed patterns of basin organization to the soil moisture dynamics. Using available geospatial data, we assign soil, climate, and vegetation properties across the basin and analyze the probabilistic characteristics of steady-state soil moisture distribution. We investigate the presence of organization through the analysis of the spatial patterns of the steady-state soil moisture distribution, as well as in the distribution of observed vegetation patterns, simulated vegetation dynamic water stress and hydrological fluxes such as transpiration. Here we show that the drainage network acts as a template for the organization of both vegetation and hydrological patterns, which exhibit self-affine characteristics in their distribution across the river basin. Our analyses suggest the existence of a balance between the large-scale determinants of vegetation pattern reflecting optimality in the response to water stress and the random small-scale patterns that arise from local factors and ecological legacies such as those caused by dispersal, disturbance, and founder effects. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The double mass curve is used to check the consistency of many kinds of Jiydrologic data by comparing data for a single station with that of a pattern composed of the data from several other stations in the area. The double-mass curve can be used to adjust inconsistent precipitation data. The graph of the cumulative data of one variable versus the cumulative data of a related variable is a straight line so long as the relation between the variables is a fixed ratio. Breaks in the double-mass curve of such variables are caused by changes in the relation between the variables. These changes may be due to changes in the method of data collection or to physical changes that affect the relation. Applications of the double-mass curve to precipitation, streamflow, and sedi- ment data, and to precipitation-runoff relations are described. A statistical test for significance of an apparent break in the slope of the double-mass curve is described by an example. Poor correlation between the variables can prevent detection of inconsistencies in a record, but an increase in the length of record tends to offset the effect of poor correlation. The residual-mass curve, which is a modification of the double-mass curve, magnifies imperceptible breaks in the double-mass curve for detailed study. Of the several methods of fitting a smooth curve to cyclic or periodic data, the moving-arc method and the double-integration method deserve greater use in hydrology. Both methods are described in this manual. The moving-arc method has general applicability, and the double integration method is useful in fitting a curve to cycles of sinusoidal form.},

abstract = {Potential evapotranspiration (PET) is an important index of hydrologic budgets at different spatial scales and is a critical variable for understanding regional biological processes. It is often an important variable in estimating actual evapotranspiration (AET) in rainfall-runoff and ecosystem modeling. However, PET is defined in different ways in the literature and quantitative estimation of PET with existing mathematical formulas produces inconsistent results. The objectives of this study are to contrast six commonly used PET methods and quantify the long term annual PET across a physiographic gradient of 36 forested watersheds in the southeastern United States. Three temperature based (Thornthwaite, Hamon, and Hargreaves-Samani) and three radiation based (Turc, Makkink, and Priestley-Taylor) PET methods are compared. Long term water balances (precipitation, streamflow, and AET) for 36 forest dominated watersheds from 0.25 to 8213 km2 in size were estimated using associated hydrometeorological and land use databases. The study found that PET values calculated from the six methods were highly correlated (Pearson Correlation Coefficient 0.85 to 1.00). Multivariate statistical tests, however, showed that PET values from different methods were significantly different from each other. Greater differences were found among the temperature based PET methods than radiation based PET methods. In general, the Priestley-Taylor, Turc, and Hamon methods performed better than the other PET methods. Based on the criteria of availability of input data and correlations with AET values, the Priestley-Taylor, Turc, and Hamon methods are recommended for regional applications in the southeastern United States.},

@article{Fernandez2000,
abstract = {As watershed models become increasingly sophisticated and useful, there is a need to extend their applicability to locations where they cannot be calibrated or validated. A new methodology for the regionalization of a watershed model is introduced and evaluated. The approach involves calibration of a watershed model to many sites in a region, concurrently. Previous research that has sought to relate the parameters of monthly water balance models to physical drainage basin characteristics in a region has met with limited success. Previous studies have taken the two-step approach: (a) estimation of watershed model parameters at each site, followed by (b) attempts to relate model parameters to drainage basin characteristics. Instead of treating these two steps as independent, both steps are implemented concurrently. All watershed models in a region are calibrated simultaneously, with the dual objective of reproducing the behaviour of observed monthly streamflows and, additionally, to obtain good relationships between watershed model parameters and basin characteristics. The approach is evaluated using 33 basins in the southeastern region of the United States by comparing simulations using the regional models for three catchments which were not used to develop the regional regression equations. Although the regional calibration approach led to nearly perfect regional relationships between watershed model parameters and basin characteristics, these “improved” regional relationships did not result in improvements in the ability to model streamflow at ungauged sites. This experiment reveals that improvements in regional relationships between watershed model parameters and basin characteristics will not necessarily lead to improvements in the ability to calibrate a watershed model at an ungauged site. {\textcopyright} 2000 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {The water balance describes climate as it is sensed by plants, as the interaction of energy and water in the environment. Discriminant analysis showed that the distribution of North American plant formations was more highly correlated with the water balance (actual evapotranspiration and deficit) than with the more traditional measures of climate (such as temperature and precipitation) used in several studies, including those used in the well-known works of Thornthwaite, Holdridge, and Whittaker. Much of the improved correlation could be attributed to the ability of the water balance to distinguish between climates similar in mean annual energy and water supplies but different in the seasonal timing of the two. Consideration of the water balance aided in the interpretation of possible mechanisms controlling the distribution of plant formations. For example, coniferous forest occurred at low actual evapotranspiration (low simultaneous availability of energy and water), consistent with the suggestion that conifers are better adapted than deciduous trees to environments with a low potential for primary production. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which climate controls vegetation distribution will help us predict the effects of changing climate on the future distribution of vegetation types.},

@article{Garcia-Ruiz2011,
abstract = {Mediterranean areas of both southern Europe and North Africa are subject to dramatic changes that will affect the sustainability, quantity, quality, and management of water resources. Most climate models forecast an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation at the end of the 21st century. This will enhance stress on natural forests and shrubs, and will result in more water consumption, evapotranspiration, and probably interception, which will affect the surface water balance and the partitioning of precipitation between evapotranspiration, runoff, and groundwater flow. As a consequence, soil water content will decline, saturation conditions will be increasingly rare and restricted to periods in winter and spring, and snow accumulation and melting will change, especially in the mid-mountain areas. Future land management will be characterized by forest and shrub expansion in most Mediterranean mountain areas, as a consequence of farmland and grazing abandonment, with increasing human pressure localized only in some places (ski resort and urbanized of valley floors). In the lowlands, particularly in the coastal fringe, increasing water demand will occur as a consequence of expansion of irrigated lands, as well as the growth of urban and industrial areas, and tourist resorts.Future scenarios for water resources in the Mediterranean region suggest (1) a progressive decline in the average streamflow (already observed in many rivers since the 1980s), including a decline in the frequency and magnitude of the most frequent floods due to the expansion of forests; (2) changes in important river regime characteristics, including an earlier decline in high flows from snowmelt in spring, an intensification of low flows in summer, and more irregular discharges in winter; (3) changes in reservoir inputs and management, including lower available discharges from dams to meet the water demand from irrigated and urban areas. Most reservoirs in mountain areas will be subject to increasing water resource uncertainty, because of the reduced influence of snow accumulation and snowmelt processes. Besides, reservoir capacity is naturally reduced due to increasing sedimentation and, in some cases, is also decreased to improve the safety control of floods, leading to a reduction in efficiency for agriculture. And (4) hydrological and population changes in coastal areas, particularly in the delta zones, affected by water depletion, groundwater reduction and saline water intrusion. These scenarios enhance the necessity of improving water management, water prizing and water recycling policies, in order to ensure water supply and to reduce tensions among regions and countries. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Several problems or issues were raised including: (i) lognormality of the data, (ii) non-stationarity of the data and (iii) anisotropy of the spatial continuity. Given that the aim of SIC'97 was to compare a variety of different approaches to estimation. IK (informed using directional indicator variogram models) was selected because it is a means to account for lognormality and it was a method that was unlikely to be used widely within the competition. Accuracy of estimates made using IK were compared with OK estimates. It was observed that the OK algorithm, as implemented here, provided more accurate estimates than IK. This was considered to be due, at least in part, to the method used for tail extrapolation and also the small number of data used in estimation (100 data locations). OK was recommended over IK in this instance as OK provided more accurate estimates and was also easier to implement.},

This dataset is developed based on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration–Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA–AVHRR) afternoon images, spanning the past three decades (1981–2015). After a careful pre-processing procedure, including calibration with post-launch calibration coefficients, geometric and topographic corrections, cloud removal, temporal filtering, and bi-weekly composites by maximum NDVI-value, we assessed changes in vegetation greening over the study domain using Mann-Kendall and Theil-Sen statistics. Our trend results were compared with those derived from some widely recognized global NDVI datasets [e.g. the Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies 3rd generation (GIMMS3g), Smoothed NDVI (SMN) and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)]. Results demonstrate that there is a good agreement between the annual trends based on Sp{\_}1km{\_}NDVI product and other datasets. Nonetheless, we found some differences in the spatial patterns of the NDVI trends at the seasonal scale. Overall, in comparison to the available global NDVI datasets, Sp{\_}1km{\_}NDVI allows for characterizing changes in vegetation greening at a more-detailed spatial and temporal scale. In specific, our dataset provides relatively long-term corrected satellite time series ({\textgreater}30 years), which are crucial to understand the response of vegetation to climate change and human-induced activities. Also, given the complex spatial structure of NDVI changes over the study domain, particularly due to the rapid land intensification processes, the spatial resolution (1.1 km) of our dataset can provide detailed spatial information on the inter-annual variability of vegetation greening in this Mediterranean region and assess its links to climate change and variability.},

abstract = {Although ensemble prediction systems (EPS) are increasingly promoted as the scientific state-of-the-art for operational flood forecasting, the communication, perception, and use of the resulting alerts have received much less attention. Using a variety of qualitative research methods, including direct user feedback at training workshops, participant observation during site visits to 25 forecasting centres across Europe, and in-depth interviews with 69 forecasters, civil protection officials, and policy makers involved in operational flood risk management in 17 European countries, this article discusses the perception, communication, and use of European Flood Alert System (EFAS) alerts in operational flood management. In particular, this article describes how the design of EFAS alerts has evolved in response to user feedback and desires for a hydrographic-like way of visualizing EFAS outputs. It also documents a variety of forecaster perceptions about the value and skill of EFAS forecasts and the best way of using them to inform operational decision making. EFAS flood alerts were generally welcomed by flood forecasters as a sort of 'pre-alert' to spur greater internal vigilance. In most cases, however, they did not lead, by themselves, to further preparatory action or to earlier warnings to the public or emergency services. Their hesitancy to act in response to medium-term, probabilistic alerts highlights some wider institutional obstacles to the hopes in the research community that EPS will be readily embraced by operational forecasters and lead to immediate improvements in flood incident management. The EFAS experience offers lessons for other hydrological services seeking to implement EPS operationally for flood forecasting and warning. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The mean squared error (MSE) and the related normalization, the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), are the two criteria most widely used for calibration and evaluation of hydrological models with observed data. Here, we present a diagnostically interesting decomposition of NSE (and hence MSE), which facilitates analysis of the relative importance of its different components in the context of hydrological modelling, and show how model calibration problems can arise due to interactions among these components. The analysis is illustrated by calibrating a simple conceptual precipitation-runoff model to daily data for a number of Austrian basins having a broad range of hydro-meteorological characteristics. Evaluation of the results clearly demonstrates the problems that can be associated with any calibration based on the NSE (or MSE) criterion. While we propose and test an alternative criterion that can help to reduce model calibration problems, the primary purpose of this study is not to present an improved measure of model performance. Instead, we seek to show that there are systematic problems inherent with any optimization based on formulations related to the MSE. The analysis and results have implications to the manner in which we calibrate and evaluate environmental models; we discuss these and suggest possible ways forward that may move us towards an improved and diagnostically meaningful approach to model performance evaluation and identification.},
annote = {Objetivo:
Hacer un diagn{\'{o}}stico del NSE como funci{\'{o}}n objetivo en la calibraci{\'{o}}n de modelos hidrol{\'{o}}gicos a partir de su descomposici{\'{o}}n. A partir de ese diagn{\'{o}}stico se propone un nuevo criterio de optimizaci{\'{o}}n.

Metodolog{\'{i}}a:
Primeramente se hace un desarrollo te{\'{o}}rico sobre la descomposici{\'{o}}n del NSE, sus limitaciones y se plantea el KGE como nuevo criterio de optimizaci{\'{o}}n.

La aplicabilidad de estos dos criterios se estudio por medio de la simulaci{\'{o}}n mediante HBV de 49 cuencas a mesoescala en Austria. El modelo se calibra de dos maneras, frente al NSE y el KGE, obteni{\'{e}}ndose dos conjuntos de par{\'{a}}metros para cada subcuenca. Sobre estas simulaciones se analiza el rendimiento global, los componentes del NSE/KGE y los conjuntos de par{\'{a}}metros optimizados.

Teor{\'{i}}as e hip{\'{o}}tesis:
Se descompone el NSE en tres componentes: la correlaci{\'{o}}n, el sesgo normalizado (a trav{\'{e}}s de la desv. t{\'{i}}pica) y la variabilidad relativa. De esta descomposici{\'{o}}n se extraen las siguientes limitaciones del NSE:
- La normalizaci{\'{o}}n del sesgo limita el peso espec{\'{i}}fico de {\'{e}}ste sobre el global del NSE, especialmente en cuencas con r{\'{e}}gimen muy variable.
- La variabilidad aparece dos veces en el NSE y se demuestra que el m{\'{a}}ximo se obtiene cuando la variabilidad es igual a la ra{\'{i}}z del coeficiente de correlaci{\'{o}}n. NSE nunca ser{\'{a}} superior, por tanto, al coeficiente de correlaci{\'{o}}n.
- Se tiende a subestimar la pendiente de las regresiones observado-simulado y viceversa, por lo que se subestiman los caudales altos y sobreestiman los caudales bajos.

Frente al NSE, se propone un nuevo criterio de optimizaci{\'{o}}n, el Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE). Es la distancia eucl{\'{i}}dea entre los tres componentes (correlaci{\'{o}}n, sesgo relativo y variabilidad relativa) y sus valores {\'{o}}ptimos (1, 0 , 1).

Resultados:
- Fuenrte correlaci{\'{o}}n entre los resultados de NSE y KGE cuando se calibra a {\'{e}}ste {\'{u}}ltimo. No es as{\'{i}} en sentido contrario.
- La correlaci{\'{o}}n es claramente el componente con m{\'{a}}s peso de los tres tanto para NSE como para KGE. Sin embargo, en el caso de KGE, no se debe a una menor ponderaci{\'{o}}n (los tres componentes tienen el mismo peso), sino a que se consiguen valores de los otros dos componentes muy pr{\'{o}}ximos al {\'{o}}ptimo.
- Mientras que ambos m{\'{e}}todos obtienen calibraciones de la correlaci{\'{o}}n similares, KGE es muy superior a NSE en la calibraci{\'{o}}n del sesgo y la variabilidad relativos. La p{\'{e}}rdida en la validaci{\'{o}}n es menor con KGE, aunque aumenta mucho la variabilidad de los dos componentes.
- NSE obtiene una recta de regresi{\'{o}}n casi ideal para la regresi{\'{o}}n de simulados sobre observados, pero muy mala al contrario. KGE obtiene valores similares para ambas regresiones, pero siempre ligeramente inferiores al {\'{o}}ptimo.
- Muy fuerte correlaci{\'{o}}n entre los valores de los par{\'{a}}metros optimizados por ambos m{\'{e}}todos (0.8). Sin embargo, peque{\~{n}}os cambios en los par{\'{a}}metros conllevan mayores cambios en el rendimiento.
- Dos valores iguales de NSE (o KGE) no tienen por qu{\'{e}} significar un mismo rendimiento. Mirando a los tres componentes del criterio, se puede discernir qu{\'{e}} conjunto es mejor/peor que otro incluyo para un mismo NSE (KGE).

The related method of the self-organizing map (SOM) is an unsupervised learning method to analyze, cluster, and model various types of large databases. There is, however, still a notable lack of comprehensive literature review for SOM along with training and data handling procedures, and potential applicability. Consequently, the present paper aims firstly to explain the algorithm and secondly, to review published applications with main emphasis on water resources problems in order to assess how well SOM can be used to solve a particular problem. It is concluded that SOM is a promising technique suitable to investigate, model, and control many types of water resources processes and systems. Unsupervised learning methods have not yet been tested fully in a comprehensive way within, for example water resources engineering. However, over the years, SOM has displayed a steady increase in the number of applications in water resources due to the robustness of the method. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, data provided by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission are applied to the land surface component of the NASA GEOS Earth system model using both data assimilation and model calibration in order to quantify the relative degrees to which each strategy improves the estimation of near-surface soil moisture and streamflow. The two approaches show significant complementarity in their ability to extract useful information from the SMAP data record. Data assimilation reduces the ubRMSE (the RMSE after removing the long-term bias) of soil moisture estimates and improves the timing of streamflow variations, whereas model calibration reduces the model biases in both soil moisture and streamflow. While both approaches lead to an improved timing of simulated soil moisture, these contributions are largely independent; joint use of both approaches provides the highest soil moisture simulation accuracy.},

abstract = {Runoff conditions are strongly controlled by climate. Therefore, any uncertainties in the projections about future climate directly translate to uncertainties in future runoff. If several climate models are applied with the same emission scenario, there may be large differences in the climate projections due to model related biases and natural climate variability. To address this issue, an ensemble modelling approach - which considers a set of climate models - is applied in this study with a monthly, conceptual hydrological model for assessing future runoff conditions in the upper Danube basin (101,810km 2). Observed data of the past 120years of the HISTALP data-set are used to evaluate runoff simulations under historic climate variations as well as to test the delta-change method for bias correction of climate data. Uncertainties caused by the hydrological model or by the method for bias correction appear to be small. Projections about future climate are obtained from 21 regional climate models (RCMs) of the ENSEMBLES project for the A1B emission scenario. Evaluation and ranking of the RCMs reveals that some of the models have considerable biases in simulation of spatio-temporal patterns of historic precipitation and temperature. There is however, no systematic relationship between historic performance and projected future change. Even for the better performing RCMs the differences in the simulation results are large. This is a strong argument for using an ensemble modelling approach, which yields a range of future runoff conditions instead of a deterministic projection. In general, a strong decrease of summer runoff is simulated, whereas there is no clear signal for changes in winter runoff. The spread between different RCMs in future seasonal runoff is larger than for the monthly flow duration curve. Overall, the projected changes in future runoff conditions become more pronounced towards the end of the 21st century. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Satellite based earth observations offer great opportunities to improve spatial model predictions by means of spatial pattern oriented model evaluations. In this study, observed spatial patterns of actual evapotranspiration (AET) are utilized for spatial model calibration tailored to target the pattern performance of the model. The proposed calibration framework combines temporally aggregated observed spatial patterns with a new spatial performance metric and a flexible spatial parameterisation scheme. The mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM) is used to simulate streamflow and AET and has been selected due to its soil parameter distribution approach based on pedotransfer functions and the build in multiscale parameter regionalization. In addition two new domain specific spatial parameter distribution options have been incorporated in the model in order to increase the flexibility of root fraction coefficient and potential evapotranspiration correction parameterisations, based on soil type and vegetation density. These parametrisations are utilized as they are most relevant for simulated AET patterns from the hydrologic model. Due to the fundamental challenges encountered when evaluating spatial pattern performance using standard metrics, we developed a simple but highly discriminative spatial metric i.e. comprised of three easily interpretable components measuring co-location, variation and distribution of the spatial data. The study shows that with flexible spatial model parameterisation used in combination with the appropriate objective functions, the simulated spatial patterns of actual evapotranspiration become substantially more similar to the satellite based estimates. Overall 26 parameters are identified for calibration through a sequential screening approach based on a combination of streamflow and spatial pattern metrics. The robustness of the calibrations is tested using an ensemble of nine calibrations based on different seed numbers using the shuffled complex evolution optimizer. The calibration results reveal a limited trade-offs between streamflow dynamics and spatial patterns illustrating the benefit of combining separate observation types and objective functions. At the same time, the simulated spatial patterns of AET significantly improved when including an objective function based on observed AET patterns and a novel spatial performance metric compared to traditional streamflow only calibration. Since the overall water balance is usually a crucial goal in the hydrologic modelling, spatial pattern oriented optimization should always be accompanied by traditional discharge measurements. In such a multi-objective framework, the current study promotes the use of a novel bias-insensitive spatial pattern metric, which exploits the key information contained in the observed patterns while allowing the water balance to be informed by discharge observations.},

abstract = {In this paper, the self-organizing map (SOM) is applied to identify the homogeneous regions for regional frequency analysis. First, the algorithm and structure of the SOM are presented. Then the experimental design is applied to test the cluster accuracy of the SOM, the K-means method and Ward's method. These three clustering methods are tested on experimental data sets where the amount of cluster dispersion and the cluster membership are controlled and known. Among the three clustering methods, the results show that the SOM determines the cluster membership more accurately than the K-means method and Ward's method. Finally, the SOM is applied to actual rainfall data in Taiwan to identify homogeneous regions for regional frequency analysis. A two-dimensional map indicates that the rain gauges can be grouped into eight clusters. A heterogeneity test indicates that the eight regions are sufficiently homogeneous. Moreover, the results show that the SOM can identify the homogeneous regions more accurately as compared to the other two clustering methods. Because of unsupervised learning, the SOM does not require the knowledge of corresponding output for comparison purposes. In addition, the SOM is more robust than the traditional clustering methods. Therefore, the SOM is recommended as an alternative to the identification of homogeneous regions for regional frequency analysis. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

While this probabilistic approach is now more or less common practice and well established in the meteorological community, operational flood forecasters have only started to look for ways to interpret and mitigate for end-users the prediction products obtained by combining so-called Ensemble Prediction Systems (EPS) of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models with rainfall-runoff models. This paper presents initial results obtained by combining deterministic and EPS hindcasts of the global NWP model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) with the large-scale hydrological model LISFLOOD for two historic flood events: the river Meuse flood in January 1995 and the river Odra flood in July 1997. In addition, a possible way to interpret the obtained ensemble based stream flow prediction is proposed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

While land use patterns and the associated explanatory variables have often been analyzed on the large scale, this study aims to determine the most important variables for explaining land use patterns in the 50 km2 catchment of the Kielstau, Germany, which is dominated by agricultural land use. A set of spatially distributed variables including topography, soil properties, socioeconomic variables, and landscape indices are exploited to set up logistic regression models for the land use map of 2017 with detailed agricultural classes. Spatial validation indicates a reasonable performance as the relative operating characteristic (ROC) ranges between 0.73 and 0.97 for all land use classes except for corn (ROC = 0.68). The robustness of the models in time is confirmed by the temporal validation for which the ROC values are on the same level (maximum deviation 0.1). Non-agricultural land use is generally better explained than agricultural land use. The most important variables are the share of drained area, distance to protected areas, population density, and patch fractal dimension. These variables can either be linked to agriculture or the river course of the Kielstau.},

abstract = {We investigated, through hydrologic modelling, the impact of the extent and density of canopy cover on streamflow timing and on the magnitude of peak and late summer flows in the upper Tuolumne basin (2600–4000 m) of the Sierra Nevada, California, under current and warmer temperatures. We used the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model for the hydrologic modelling of the basin, assuming four vegetation scenarios: current forest (partial cover, 80{\%} density), all forest (uniform coverage, 80{\%} density), all barren (no forest) and thinned forest (partial cover, 40{\%} density) for a medium-high emissions scenario causing a 3.9 °C warming over a 100-year period (2001–2100). Significant advances in streamflow timing, quantified as the centre of mass (COM) of over 1 month were projected for all vegetation scenarios. However, the COM advances faster with increased forest coverage. For example, when forest covered the entire area, the COM occurred on average 12 days earlier compared with the current forest coverage, with the rate of advance higher by about 0.06 days year−1 over 100 years and with peak and late summer flows lower by about 20{\%} and 27{\%}, respectively. Examination of modelled changes in energy balance components at forested and barren sites as temperatures rise indicated that increases in net longwave radiation are higher in the forest case and have a higher contribution to melting earlier in the calendar year when shortwave radiation is a smaller fraction of the energy budget. These increases contributed to increased midwinter melt under the forest at temperatures above freezing, causing decreases in total accumulation and higher winter and early spring melt rates. These results highlight the importance of carefully considering the combined impacts of changing forest cover and climate on downstream water supply and mountain ecosystems.

Currently, conventional models do not include groundwater transpiration and the results frequently underestimate the actual evapotranspiration and overestimate the net recharge. Therefore, in this work we focus on how a multi-variable calibration with a multi-objective approach may improve model robustness leading to a more realistic closure of the water balance in two models (LEACHM and TETIS) of different conceptualisation taking into account the specific characteristics of a facultative phreatophytic forest. The results suggest that the common single-variable and single-objective calibration is not able to measure all system's characteristics. However, the multi-variable and multi-objective calibration proved a good option to reproduce the water dynamics of a facultative phreatophytic forest and confirmed that groundwater transpiration is an important water source for them. Therefore, hydrological models should include this mechanism and both LEACHM and TETIS proved an acceptable tool to be applied in the regions covered by this species.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the issues involved in treating hydrology as an example of an inexact science faced with significant epistemic uncertainties. It proposes a novel method for developing limits of acceptability for testing hydrological models as hypotheses about how a catchment hydrological system might function. The approach is based only on an analysis of the available observations and the consideration of event mass balance for successive rainfall-runoff events. It is shown that there are many events that are subject to epistemic uncertainties in the input data so that mass balance is not satisfied. The proposed approach allows taking these epistemic uncertainties into account in a pragmatic way before any model runs are made. It is an approach that might be applicable in other areas of environmental science where similar basic principles are fundamental to models, but which might not be satisfied by the observations that are used for model evaluation.},

abstract = {The Picos de Europa National Park, with a total area of 675 km2, is located in the North of Spain, in the provinces of Asturias, Cantabria and Le{\'{o}}n. Carbonated materials predominate in the North and central areas of the Park, whilst to the South rocks are mainly siliceous. The complex geological structure caused by the superposition of two orogenies has conditioned the presence of a very karstified limestone series more than 2 km thick.The karst development is really important and it is well known that the Picos de Europa high mountains contain 14 {\%} of the deepest discovered caves in the world. As far as hydrological planning is concerned, the park is integrated into the 016.214 Picos de Europa-Panes and 016.218 Alto Deva-Alto Cares groundwater bodies. The geological formations present in the Picos de Europa National Park, considering the permeability characteristics of the materials, can be classified as either aquifers or aquitards. The main aquifer is karst in nature and includes a powerful series of carboniferous limestones with an O-E orientation. The presence of siliciclastic formations, which behave like aquitards, determine the compartmentalization of the aquifer into “smaller underground water bodies” (hereinafter SGWB, the acronym for the English terminology, “smaller groundwater bodies”) with dimensions of between 2 and 108 km3 in volume. The piezometric level in the dif-ferent SGWBs varies between 120 and 1,200 m a.s.l., descending in a staggered way to the North. It should be noted that in the Central and Eastern Massifs the piezometry is more uniform and is located between 300 and 500 m a.s.l. To the northern of the limit of the park, the main points of discharge of the carbonated aquifer are located between 120 and 150 m a.s.l. The aquifer recharge, preferably by direct infiltration, has a clear snow influence.The karst springs jointly discharge the water from the surface runoff infiltrated into the aquifer and the groundwater that comes from the different SGWBs. The presence of siliciclastic units, with general W-E directions that function as permeability barriers has caused the circulation of the underground flow to be directed predominantly northwards, and therefore, has led to the main springs being located in the northern part of the park.},

In an effort to frame a more inclusive paradigm for river management, we discuss sediment inputs, transport, and storage within river systems; interactions among water, sediment, and valley context; and the need to broaden the natural flow regime concept. Explicitly incorporating sediment is challenging, because sediment is supplied, transported, and stored by nonlinear and episodic processes operating at different temporal and spatial scales than water and because sediment regimes have been highly altered by humans. Nevertheless, managing for a desired balance between sediment supply and transport capacity is not only tractable, given current geomorphic process knowledge, but also essential because of the importance of sediment regimes to aquatic and riparian ecosystems, the physical template of which depends on sediment-driven river structure and function.},

The KARSYS approach provides an explicit 3D conceptual model of the geometry and the functioning of karst aquifers that has been successfully applied in Swiss and Slovenian aquifers. In this work, KARSYS is applied in a complex geological area: the Picos de Europa National Park (Spain). The hydrogeological 3D model (500 km2) shows an alpine karst aquifer compartmentalized into 32 groundwater bodies dammed up by subvertical barriers creating elevated saturated zones (water tables at 1153 m asl) and lower ones (water tables at 145 m asl). The recharge is through 18 spring catchment areas. The groundwater flows to the saturated zones pass through vertical to inclined trajectories, and phreatic flows are oriented toward NW, NE and N. KARSYS can be applied to any geologically complex area at a regional scale, although the geological structure should be simplified and the precision in some places is low. Nevertheless, KARSYS helps to identify the hydrogeological behavior of karst areas and is a useful guide for future hydrogeological researches.},

abstract = {Lateral water flow in catchments can produce important patterns in water and nutrient fluxes and stores and also influences the long-term spatial development of forest ecosystems. Specifically, patterns of vegetation type and density along hydrologic flow paths can represent a signal of the redistribution of water and nitrogen mediated by lateral hydrologic flow. This study explores the use of emergent vegetation patterns to infer ecohydrologic processes and feedbacks in forested headwater catchments. We suggest a hydrologic gradient of vegetation density as an indicator of lateral connectivity within headwater catchments. We define the hydrologic vegetation gradient (HVG) as the increase of normalized difference vegetation index per unit increase of the topographic wetness index. HVG are estimated in different headwater catchments in the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory using summer IKONOS imagery. We use recession slope analysis with gauge data and a distributed ecohydrological model to characterize the patterns of seasonal flow regimes within the catchments. Correlations between HVG, catchment runoff, early recession parameters, and model parameters show the interactive role of vegetation and lateral hydrologic connectivity of systems in addition to climatic and geomorphic controls. This suggests that HVG effectively represents the level of partitioning between localized water use and lateral water flow along hydrologic flow paths, especially during the growing season. It also presents the potential to use simple remotely sensed hydrologic vegetation gradients as an indicator of lateral hydrologic connectivity to extrapolate recession behavior and key model parameters of distributed hydrological models for ungauged headwater catchments.},

Specifically, the multi-criteria framework enables recognition and handling of errors and uncertainties, and detection of prominent behavioural solutions with acceptable trade-offs. Particularly in models of complex parameterization, a multiobjective approach becomes essential for improving the identifiability of parameters and augmenting the information contained in calibration by means of both multi-response measurements and empirical metrics ("soft" data), which account for the hydrological expertise. Based on the literature review, we also provide alternative techniques for dealing with conflicting and non-commeasurable criteria, and hybrid strategies to utilize the information gained towards identifying promising compromise solutions that ensure consistent and reliable calibrations. {\textcopyright} 2010 IAHS Press.},

abstract = {Surface soil moisture has a direct impact on food security, human health and ecosystem function. It also plays a key role in the climate system, and the development and persistence of extreme weather events such as droughts, floods and heatwaves. However, sparse and uneven observations have made it diicult to quantify the global distribution and dynamics of surface soil moisture. Here we introduce a metric of soil moisture memory and use a full year of global observations from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive mission to show that surface soil moisture—a storage believed to make up less than 0.001{\%} of the global freshwater budget by volume, and equivalent to an, on average, 8-mm thin layer of water covering all land surfaces—plays a significant role in the water cycle. Specifically, we find that surface soil moisture retains a median 14{\%} of precipitation falling on land after three days. Furthermore, the retained fraction of the surface soil moisture storage after three days is highest over arid regions, and in regions where drainage to groundwater storage is lowest. We conclude that lower groundwater storage in these regions is due not only to lower precipitation, but also to the complex partitioning of the water cycle by the surface soil moisture storage layer at the land surface. A rguably, one of the most fundamental tasks of hydrologic science is to quantify the distribution of water across global storages (which we term the 'water budget'), and the rates at which water cycles between them (the 'water cycle'). The water cycle is often quantified in terms of a storage's average 'residence time' (the time water spends in the storage, on average, between entering and exiting) or 'memory' (broadly, the time taken for the storage to dissipate a positive or negative anomaly). Many previous studies have provided estimates of these quantities, for storages including the atmosphere, groundwater, glaciers and oceans (for example, ref. 1). At the interface of the lithosphere (which has residence times on the order of months to tens of thousands of years) and atmosphere (which has residence times on the order of days), the surface soil layer (defined here as ∼5-cm deep) displays},

abstract = {Soil water potential (SWP) is known to affect plant water status, and even though observations demonstrate that SWP distribution around roots may limit plant water avail-ability, its horizontal heterogeneity within the root zone is of-ten neglected in hydrological models. As motive, using a hor-izontal discretisation significantly larger than one centimetre is often essential for computing time considerations, espe-cially for large-scale hydrodynamics models. In this paper, we simulate soil and root system hydrodynamics at the cen-timetre scale and evaluate approaches to upscale variables and parameters related to root water uptake (RWU) for two crop systems: a densely seeded crop with an average uniform distribution of roots in the horizontal direction (winter wheat) and a wide-row crop with lateral variations in root density (maize). In a first approach, the upscaled water potential at soil–root interfaces was assumed to equal the bulk SWP of the upscaled soil element. Using this assumption, the 3-D high-resolution model could be accurately upscaled to a 2-D model for maize and a 1-D model for wheat. The accuracy of the upscaled models generally increased with soil hydraulic conductivity, lateral homogeneity of root distribution, and low transpiration rate. The link between horizontal upscaling and an implicit assumption on soil water redistribution was demonstrated in quantitative terms, and explained upscaling accuracy. In a second approach, the soil–root interface water potential was estimated by using a constant rate analytical so-lution of the axisymmetric soil water flow towards individual roots. In addition to the theoretical model properties, effec-tive properties were tested in order to account for unfulfilled assumptions of the analytical solution: non-uniform lateral root distributions and transient RWU rates. Significant im-provements were however only noticed for winter wheat, for which the first approach was already satisfying. This study confirms that the use of 1-D spatial discretisation to repre-sent soil–plant water dynamics is a worthy choice for densely seeded crops. For wide-row crops, e.g. maize, further theo-retical developments that better account for horizontal SWP heterogeneity might be needed in order to properly predict soil–plant hydrodynamics in 1-D.},

Here we propose a new framework to diagnose the salient cause of poor model performance in changing climate conditions, be it structural inadequacy, poor parameterization, or data errors. The framework can be applied to a single catchment, although larger samples of catchments are helpful to generalize and/or cross-check results. To generate a diagnosis, multiple historic periods with contrasting climate are defined, and the limits of model robustness and flexibility are explored over each period separately and for all periods together. Numerous data-based checks also supplement the results. Using a case study catchment from Australia, improved inference of structural failure and clearer evaluation of model structural improvements are demonstrated. This framework enables future studies to (i) identify cases where poor simulations are due to poor calibration methods or data errors, remediating these cases without recourse to structural changes; and (ii) use the remaining cases to gain greater clarity into what structural changes are needed to improve model performance in changing climate.},

abstract = {The empirical Ball–Berry stomatal conductance model is commonly used in Earth system models to simulate biotic regulation of evapotranspiration. However, the dependence of stomatal conductance ({\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}s{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) on vapor pressure deficit ({\textless}i{\textgreater}D{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}s{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) and soil moisture must both be empirically parameterized. We evaluated the Ball–Berry model used in the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) and an alternative stomatal conductance model that links leaf gas exchange, plant hydraulic constraints, and the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum (SPA) to numerically optimize photosynthetic carbon gain per unit water loss while preventing leaf water potential dropping below a critical minimum level. We evaluated two alternative optimization algorithms: intrinsic water-use efficiency ({\&}Delta; {\textless}i{\textgreater}A{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}n{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}/{\&}Delta; {\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}s{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, the marginal carbon gain of stomatal opening) and water-use efficiency ({\&}Delta; {\textless}i{\textgreater}A{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}n{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}/{\&}Delta; {\textless}i{\textgreater}E{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}l{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, the marginal carbon gain of water loss). We implemented the stomatal models in a multi-layer plant canopy model, to resolve profiles of gas exchange, leaf water potential, and plant hydraulics within the canopy, and evaluated the simulations using: (1) leaf analyses; (2) canopy net radiation, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, and gross primary production at six AmeriFlux sites spanning 51 site–years; and (3) parameter sensitivity analyses. Without soil moisture stress, the performance of the SPA stomatal conductance model was generally comparable to or somewhat better than the Ball–Berry model in flux tower simulations, but was significantly better than the Ball–Berry model when there was soil moisture stress. Functional dependence of {\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}s{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} on soil moisture emerged from the physiological theory linking leaf water-use efficiency and water flow to and from the leaf along the soil-to-leaf pathway rather than being imposed a priori, as in the Ball–Berry model. Similar functional dependence of {\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}s{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} on {\textless}i{\textgreater}D{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}s{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emerged from the water-use efficiency optimization. Sensitivity analyses showed that two parameters (stomatal efficiency and root hydraulic conductivity) minimized errors with the SPA stomatal conductance model. The critical stomatal efficiency for optimization ({\&}iota;) was estimated from leaf trait datasets and is related to the slope parameter ({\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) of the Ball–Berry model. The optimized parameter value was consistent with this estimate. Optimized root hydraulic conductivity was consistent with estimates from literature surveys. The two central concepts embodied in the stomatal model, that plants account for both water-use efficiency and for hydraulic safety in regulating stomatal conductance, imply a notion of optimal plant strategies and provide testable model hypotheses, rather than empirical descriptions of plant behavior.},

abstract = {Purpose: To develop consensus regarding clinical disease severity classification systems for diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema that can be used around the world, and to improve communication and coordination of care among physicians who care for patients with diabetes. Design: Report regarding the development of clinical diabetic retinopathy disease severity scales. Participants: A group of 31 individuals from 16 countries, representing comprehensive ophthalmology, retina subspecialties, endocrinology, and epidemiology. Methods: An initial clinical classification system, based on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study and the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy publications, was circulated to the group in advance of a workshop. Each member reviewed this using e-mail, and a modified Delphi system was used to stratify responses. At a later workshop, separate systems for diabetic retinopathy and macular edema were developed. These were then reevaluated by group members, and the modified Delphi system was again used to measure degrees of agreement. Main Outcome Measures: Consensus regarding specific classification systems was achieved. Results: A five-stage disease severity classification for diabetic retinopathy includes three stages of low risk, a fourth stage of severe nonproliferative retinopathy, and a fifth stage of proliferative retinopathy. Diabetic macular edema is classified as apparently present or apparently absent. If training and equipment allow the screener to make a valid decision, macular edema is further categorized as a function of its, distance from the central macula. Conclusions: There seems to be a genuine need for consistent international clinical classification systems for diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema that are supported with solid evidence. The proposed clinical classification systems provide a means of appropriately categorizing diabetic retinopathy and macular edema. It is hoped that these systems will be valuable in improving both screening of individuals with diabetes and communication and discussion among individuals caring for these patients. {\textcopyright} 2003 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.},

Introduction New applications in nanophotonics could be given interesting functionalities if one could control the way these structures distribute the scattered light in space. Several years ago, M. Kerker, D. Wang and C. Giles showed that for dipole-like particles with certain values of their optical properties, the scattering can be suppressed in certain directions and enhanced in others. Kerker's study was presented for ideal point particles with dimensions negligible compared to the incident wavelength. In this chapter, we present a formal study of the conditions for and µ as proposed by the former authors as well as a generalization to finite-size particles. Finally a generalization to other scattering directions will also be presented. 67},

abstract = {The mass change information from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (grace) satellite mission is available in terms of noisy spherical harmonic coefficients truncated at a maximum degree (band-limited). Therefore, filtering is an inevitable step in post-processing of grace fields to extract meaningful information about mass redistribution in the Earth-system. It is well known from previous studies that a number can be allotted to the spatial resolution of a band-limited spherical harmonic spectrum and also to a filtered field. Furthermore, it is now a common practice to correct the filtered grace data for signal damage due to filtering (or convolution in the spatial domain). These correction methods resemble deconvolution, and, therefore, the spatial resolution of the corrected grace data have to be reconsidered. Therefore, the effective spatial resolution at which we can obtain mass changes from grace products is an area of debate. In this contribution, we assess the spatial resolution both theoretically and practically. We confirm that, theoretically, the smallest resolvable catchment is directly related to the band-limit of the spherical harmonic spectrum of the grace data. However, due to the approximate nature of the correction schemes and the noise present in grace data, practically, the complete band-limited signal cannot be retrieved. In this context, we perform a closed-loop simulation comparing four popular correction schemes over 255 catchments to demarcate the minimum size of the catchment whose signal can be efficiently recovered by the correction schemes. We show that the amount of closure error is inversely related to the size of the catchment area. We use this trade-off between the error and the catchment size for defining the potential spatial resolution of the grace product obtained from a correction method. The magnitude of the error and hence the spatial resolution are both dependent on the correction scheme. Currently, a catchment of the size {\&}asymp;63,000 km 2 can be resolved at an error level of 2 cm in terms of equivalent water height.},

abstract = {We know more about vegetation change on the Santa Rita Experimental Range since 1903 than is known about any other 20,000-ha area in the world. This record is only possible because important techniques of measuring vegetation changes were developed on the Santa Rita, such as repeat photography and the line intercept transect method, and because they were applied often and broadly. A 100-year record of experiments and systematic observations nourishes the interpretation of these changes. Together, they describe a steady increase of mesquite trees, four cycles of burroweed eruption and decline, one cholla cactus cycle, interannual and interdecadal variation in native grass composition, and the recent dominance of the nonnative Lehmann lovegrass. The most conspicuous change is the increase of mesquite, which began before 1903 when the spread of seed by livestock and cessation of fire led to the establishment of mesquite in the open grasslands. The growth of these plants and subsequent recruits transformed the grasslands into a mesquite-grass savanna, and neither the elimination of livestock grazing nor the occasional fire has reversed this change. Burroweed cycles appear to be more closely related to winter precipitation patterns and maximum plant longevity than land management activities. Similarly, the increase of Lehmann lovegrass is largely independent of livestock grazing management},

abstract = {The requirements for hydrological models have increased considerably during the previous decades to cope with the resolution of extensive remotely sensed data sets and a number of demanding applications. Existing models exhibit deficiencies such as overparameterization, the lack of an effective technique to integrate the spatial heterogeneity of physiographic characteristics, and the nontransferability of parameters across scales and locations. A multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR) technique is proposed as a way to address these issues simultaneously. Using this technique, parameters at a coarser scale, in which the dominant hydrological processes are represented, are linked with their corresponding ones at a finer resolution in which input data sets are available. The linkage is done with upscaling operators such as the harmonic mean, among others. Parameters at the finer scale are regionalized through nonlinear transfer functions which link basin predictors with global parameters to be determined through calibration. MPR was compared with a standard regionalization (SR) method in which basin predictors instead of model parameters are first aggregated. Both methods were tested in a basin located in Germany using a distributed hydrologic model. Results indicate that MPR is superior to SR in many respects, especially if global parameters are transferred from coarser to finer scales. Furthermore, MPR, as opposed to SR, preserves the spatial variability of state variables and conserves the mass balance with respect to a control scale. Cross-validation tests indicate that the transferability of the global parameters to ungauged locations is possible. Copyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {A traditional metric used in hydrology to summarize model performance is the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). Increasingly an alternative metric, the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), is used instead. When NSE is used, NSE = 0 corresponds to using the mean flow as a benchmark predictor. The same reasoning is applied in various studies that use KGE as a metric: negative KGE values are viewed as bad model performance, and only positive values are seen as good model performance. Here we show that using the mean flow as a predictor does not result in KGE=0, but instead KGE = 1- √ 2 ∼ -0:41. Thus, KGE values greater than -0:41 indicate that a model improves upon the mean flow benchmark - even if the model's KGE value is negative. NSE and KGE values cannot be directly compared, because their relationship is non-unique and depends in part on the coefficient of variation of the observed time series. Therefore, modellers who use the KGE metric should not let their understanding of NSE values guide them in interpreting KGE values and instead develop new understanding based on the constitutive parts of the KGE metric and the explicit use of benchmark values to compare KGE scores against. More generally, a strong case can be made for moving away from ad hoc use of aggregated efficiency metrics and towards a framework based on purpose-dependent evaluation metrics and benchmarks that allows for more robust model adequacy assessment.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Distributed hydrological models are traditionally evaluated against discharge stations, emphasizing the temporal and neglecting the spatial component of a model. The present study widens the traditional paradigm by highlighting spatial patterns of evapotranspiration (ET), a key variable at the land–atmosphere interface, obtained from two different approaches at the national scale of Denmark. The first approach is based on a national water resources model (DK-model), using the MIKE-SHE model code, and the second approach utilizes a two-source energy balance model (TSEB) driven mainly by satellite remote sensing data. Ideally, the hydrological model simulation and remote-sensing-based approach should present similar spatial patterns and driving mechanisms of ET. However, the spatial comparison showed that the differences are significant and indicate insufficient spatial pattern performance of the hydrological model.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}The differences in spatial patterns can partly be explained by the fact that the hydrological model is configured to run in six domains that are calibrated independently from each other, as it is often the case for large-scale multi-basin calibrations. Furthermore, the model incorporates predefined temporal dynamics of leaf area index (LAI), root depth (RD) and crop coefficient (Kc) for each land cover type. This zonal approach of model parameterization ignores the spatiotemporal complexity of the natural system. To overcome this limitation, this study features a modified version of the DK-model in which LAI, RD and Kc are empirically derived using remote sensing data and detailed soil property maps in order to generate a higher degree of spatiotemporal variability and spatial consistency between the six domains. The effects of these changes are analyzed by using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to evaluate spatial patterns. The EOF analysis shows that including remote-sensing-derived LAI, RD and Kc in the distributed hydrological model adds spatial features found in the spatial pattern of remote-sensing-based ET.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The structure and function of vegetation regulate fluxes across the biosphere-atmosphere interface with large effects in water-limited ecosystems. Vegetation dynamics are often neglected in hydrological modeling except for simple prescriptions of seasonal phenology. However, changes in vegetation densities, influencing the partitioning of incoming solar energy into sensible and latent heat fluxes, can result in long-term changes in both local and global climates with resulting feedbacks on vegetation growth. This paper seeks a simple vegetation dynamics model (VDM) for simulation of the leaf area index (LAI) dynamics in hydrologic models. Five variants of a VDM are employed, with a range of model complexities. The VDMs are coupled to a land surface model (LSM), with the VDM providing the LAI evolution through time and the LSM using this to compute the land surface fluxes and update the soil water contents. We explore the models through case studies of water-limited grass fields in California (United States) and North Carolina (United States). Results show that a simple VDM, simulating only the living aboveground green biomass (i.e., with low parameterization), is able to accurately simulate the LAI. Results also highlight the importance of including the VDM in the LSM when studying the climate-soil-vegetation interactions over moderate to long timescales. The inclusion of the VDM in the LSM is demonstrated to be essential for assessing the impact of interannual rainfall variability on the water budget of a water limited region.},

Also, GEOMOD2 extrapolates the pattern of land-use to$\backslash$nthe year 2010. When GEOMOD2 extrapolates land-use change over several$\backslash$ndecades, it is able to classify correctly between 74 and 88{\%} of the$\backslash$ngrid cells, for two categories: forest versus non-forest. Over various$\backslash$nsimulation runs, Kappa ranges from 0.31 to 0.53. The model's ability$\backslash$nto predict the location of disturbance is best when the model is$\backslash$ndriven by the location of biogeophysical characteristics, most importantly$\backslash$nlifezones.{\textless}/P{\textgreater}},

abstract = {In the context of global change exacerbating the water crisis, it is difficult to solve the new problems of water resource management based on traditional hydrology without considering other aspects of water circulation, such as biotic dynamics. Vegetation, which once was thought to play only a relatively minor role and was ignored or treated as a static component in models, has now been recognized as one of the most important factors in water circulation. Ecohydrology has been promoted as a concept that links ecological and hydrological processes and considers interactions between water resources and ecosystems. Ecohydrological models are not only important tools for studying the mechanisms of ecological patterns and processes but also essential tools to assess the effects of environmental change on hydrological and ecological processes, providing solutions to issues of water management. This paper: 1) analyzes the characteristics of the interactions between terrestrial vegetation and hydrological processes; 2) summarizes the categories of existing watershed ecohydrological models for analysis and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of different kinds of ecohydrological models; 3) reviews the typical achievements of the application of ecohydrological models; and 4) illustrates the key issues of ecohydrological models at the watershed scale.},

In the search for consistent and automated baseflow separation techniques, direct applicability to physical processes has been increasingly neglected. By way of contrast, this paper presents a continuous baseflow separation method that emphasises the physical relevance of the flow components, and demonstrates its performance. The proposed method combines the principle of an exponential master baseflow recession with a compatible smoothing function to link the segments of the master recession. Two calibrated parameters facilitate a good fit to a range of streamflow behaviours.},

The observed seasonal and annual streamflows in the reference network have undergone generalized and significant decreases during the study period. Annual rainfall did not experienced statistically significant changes. The observed trends in streamflows may be attributed to either land-use changes, or to the statistically significant changes exhibited both by yearly potential evapotranspiration values and by the seasonal redistribution of precipitation. In the attribution work conducted using both data-based and simulation-based methods, the intra-annual redistribution of precipitation is shown to be the main statistically significant climate-driver of streamflow change. The contributions of other non-climate factors, such as changes in land cover, to the reduction in annual streamflows are shown to be minor in comparison.},

abstract = {AbstractThe Soil and Water Integrated Model (SWIM) is a continuous-time semi-distributed ecohydrological model, integrating hydrological processes, vegetation, nutrients and erosion. It was developed for impact assessment at the river basin scale. SWIM is coupled to GIS and has modest data requirements. During the last decade SWIM was extensively tested in mesoscale and large catchments for hydrological processes (discharge, groundwater), nutrients, extreme events (floods and low flows), crop yield and erosion. Several modules were developed further (wetlands and snow dynamics) or introduced (glaciers, reservoirs). After validation, SWIM can be applied for impact assessment. Four exemplary studies are presented here, and several questions important to the impact modelling community are discussed. For which processes and areas can the model be used?

@article{Stoelzle2015,
abstract = {Previous work has shown that streamflow response during baseflow conditions is a function of storage, but also that this functional relationship varies among seasons and catchments. Traditionally, hydrological models incorporate conceptual groundwater models consisting of linear or non-linear storage-outflow functions. Identification of the right model structure and model parameterization however is challenging. The aim of this paper is to systematically test different model structures in a set of catchments where different aquifer types govern baseflow generation processes. Nine different two-parameter conceptual groundwater models are applied with multi-objective calibration to transform two different groundwater recharge series derived from a soil-atmosphere-vegetation transfer model into baseflow separated from streamflow data. The relative performance differences of the model structures allow to systematically improve the understanding of baseflow generation processes and to identify most appropriate model structures for different aquifer types. We found more versatile and more aquifer-specific optimal model structures and elucidate the role of interflow, flow paths, recharge regimes and partially contributing storages. Aquifer-specific recommendations of storage models were found for fractured and karstic aquifers, whereas large storage capacities blur the identification of superior model structures for complex and porous aquifers. A model performance matrix is presented, which highlights the joint effects of different recharge inputs, calibration criteria, model structures and aquifer types. The matrix is a guidance to improve groundwater model structures towards their representation of the dominant baseflow generation processes of specific aquifer types.},

The four articles in the series discuss whether and how the process of testing hypotheses leads to progress in hydrology. Repeated experiments with controlled boundary conditions are rarely feasible in hydrology. Research is therefore not easily aligned with the classical scientific method of testing hypotheses. Hypotheses in hydrology are often enshrined in computer models which are tested against observed data. Testability may be limited due to model complexity and data uncertainty. All four articles suggest that hypothesis testing has contributed to progress in hydrology and is needed in the future. However, the procedure is usually not as systematic as the philosophy of science suggests. A greater emphasis on a creative reasoning process on the basis of clues and explorative analyses is therefore needed.},

abstract = {Optimal hydrograph separation (OHS) uses a two-parameter recursive digital filter that applies specific conductance mass-balance constraints to estimate the base flow contribution to total streamflow at stream gages where discharge and specific conductance are measured. OHS was applied to U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream gages across the conterminous United States to examine the range/distribution of base flow inputs and the utility of this method to build a hydrologic model calibration dataset. OHS models with acceptable goodness-of-fit criteria were insensitive to drainage area, stream density, watershed slope, elevation, agricultural or perennial snow/ice land cover, average annual precipitation, runoff, or evapotranspiration, implying that OHS results are a viable calibration dataset applicable in diverse watersheds. OHS-estimated base flow contribution was compared to base flow-like model components from the USGS National Hydrologic Model Infrastructure run with the Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (NHM-PRMS). The NHM-PRMS variable gwres{\_}flow is most conceptually like a base flow component of streamflow but the gwres{\_}flow contribution to total streamflow is generally smaller than the OHS-estimated base flow contribution. The NHM-PRMS variable slow{\_}flow, added to gwres{\_}flow, produced similar or greater estimates of base flow contributions to total streamflow than the OHS-estimated base flow contribution but was dependent on the total flow magnitude.},

The results suggest that among several expressions, Boussinesq's nonlinear solution of free surface groundwater flow is best suited to parameterize the observed hydrographs. The obtained parameters can be related to the basin characteristics, viz., drainage area and the total stream length, in accordance with relationships derived on the basis of the Dupuit‐Boussinesq aquifer model.

abstract = {It may be endemic to mechanistic modelling of complex environmental systems that there are many different model structures and many different parameter sets within a chosen model structure that may be behavioural or acceptable in reproducing the observed behaviour of that system. This has been called the equifinality concept. The generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) methodology for model identification allowing for equifinality is described. Prediction within this methodology is a process of ensemble forecasting using a sample of parameter sets from the behavioural model space, with each sample weighted according to its likelihood measure to estimate prediction quantiles. This allows that different models may contribute to the ensemble prediction interval at different time steps and that the distributional form of the predictions may change over time. Any effects of model nonlinearity, covariation of parameter values and errors in model structure, input data or observed variables, with which the simulations are compared, are handled implicitly within this procedure. GLUE involves a number of choices that must be made explicit and can be therefore subjected to scrutiny and discussion. These include ways of combining information from different types of model evaluation or from different periods in a data assimilation context. An example application to rainfall-runoff modelling is used to illustrate the methodology, including the updating of likelihood measures. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {This article describes the development and calibration of a mass and energy balance snowmelt point model for the south-facing slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains (Spain) and brings attention to snow processes taking place in a Mediterranean site, especially to high evaporation rates. This mountain range has peaks rising to 3500 m, and is located at latitude 37{\{}ring operator{\}}N, surrounded by a mild Mediterranean climate. Energy balance over the snowpack is subjected to very changeable weather conditions such as episodic strong low humidity winds, clear skies with very low nocturnal temperatures, intense solar radiation and sudden increases in temperatures. We found the behavior of the snow to be extremely variable throughout the year, especially in regards to melting cycles and evaporation. Simulations, based on snow water equivalent measurements, show that during 2004-2005, 42{\%} of the total snow precipitation evaporated. Only 124 mm of the 300 mm of snowfall collected at the monitoring point actually melted. However, evaporation can range from 80{\%} in December to 20{\%} during the spring months and from 20{\%} to 40{\%} between years. The variability of the balance of energy fluxes acting on the snow cover in this basin means that all fluxes will be important at some point during the accumulation process. This is an excellent context for testing an energy balance model because of the widely diverse situations occurring at this location during the same time period. In order to calibrate the model, it was necessary to remove the stability-correction factors for non-adiabatic temperature gradients of the turbulent transfer, which are important for evaporation. The sensible-heat transfer coefficient in windless conditions is raised to 6 W/m2K. An empirical relationship for atmospheric emissivity calculation is derived from the observed relative humidity, as the well-known Brutsaert's formula clearly underestimated this value under cloudy skies. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Effective water resources management in California relies substantially on real-time information of snow water equivalent (SWE) at basin scale and mountain ranges given that mountain snowpacks provide the primary water supply for the State. However, SWE estimation based solely on remote sensing, modeling, or ground observations does not meet contemporary operational requirements. In this context, this study develops a data-fusion framework that combines multi-source datasets including satellite-observed daily mean fractional snow-covered area (DMFSCA), snow pillow SWE measurements, physiographic data, and historical SWE patterns into a linear regression model (LRM) to improve SWE estimates in real-time. We test two LRMs: a baseline regression model (LRM-baseline) that uses physiographic data and historical SWE patterns as independent variables, and an FSCA-informed regression model (LRM-FSCA) that includes the DMFSCA from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery as an additional independent variable. By incorporating the satellite-observed DMFSCA, LRM-FSCA outperforms LRM-baseline with increased median R2 from 0.54 to 0.60, and reduced median PBIAS of basin average SWE from 2.6{\%} to 2.2{\%} in the snow pillow SWE cross-validation. LRM-FSCA explains 87{\%} of the variance in the snow course SWE measurements with 0.1{\%} PBIAS, while LRM-baseline explains a lower 81{\%} variance with 1.4{\%} PBIAS, both of which show higher accuracy than SWE estimates from the two operational SWE datasets: the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS, 73{\%} and -2.4{\%}, respectively) and Nationtional Water Model (NWM, 75{\%} and -15.9{\%}, respectively). Additionally, LRM-FSCA explains 85{\%} of the median variance in the Airborne Snow Observatory SWE with -9.2{\%} PBIAS, which is comparable to the LRM-baseline (86{\%} and -11.3{\%}, respectively) and considerably better than SNODAS (64{\%} and 28.2{\%}, respectively) and NWM (33{\%} and -30.1{\%}, respectively). This study shows a substantial model improvement by constraining the geographical and seasonal variation on snow-cover via satellite observation and highlights the values of using multi-source observations in real-time SWE estimation. The developed SWE estimation framework has crucial implications for effective water supply forecasting and management in California, where climate extremes (e.g., droughts and floods) require particularly skillful monitoring practices.},

abstract = {A Climatological Atlas is composed of graphically information relating to the climate of a country or region, where this information is to be used for a wide range of different users. Climatological Atlases are considered essential for the socio-economic development of geographical regions they cover. For this reason the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has established rules governing the drafting and publication of Climatological Atlases, recommending that these publications aim to meet the needs of a large number of different users, and yet still serve as a basis for the creation of regional atlases. Regarding the geographical unit of the Iberian Peninsula, there are obvious advantages to drafting a Climatological Atlas for this region, covering both Portuguese and Spanish territories. As such, this Cli- matological Atlas is intended to describe the main climatological characteristics of the Iberian Peninsula, including the Balearic Islands, as agreed by the mete- orological services of both Portugal (IM, I.P.) and Spain (AEMet). For reasons of geographical and climatic con- tinuity, this edition does not include the Macaronesian Islands (Archipelagos of Madeira, the Azores and the Canary Islands). The basic information used to produce this Atlas was, in general, taken from climate normals (average values) concerning 1971-2000 period, in accordance with the recommendations of the WMO. Climate normals are used as basis for classifying the climate of a given region, supporting policy and management decisions within various socio-economic areas, such as urban planning, agriculture and forestry, energy and transport, tourism and the environment, among others.},

abstract = {Hydrologic models are usually calibrated using observed river runoff at catchment outlets. Streamflow, however, represents an integral response of the entire catchment and is observed at a few locations worldwide. Parameter estimation based on streamflow has the disadvantage that it does not consider the spatiotemporal variability of hydrologic states and fluxes such as evapotranspiration. Remotely sensed data, in contrast, include these variabilities and are broadly available. In this study, we assess the predictive skill of satellite‐derived land surface temperature (Ts) with respect to river runoff (Q). We developed a bias‐insensitive pattern‐matching criterion to focus the parameter optimization on spatial patterns of Ts. The proposed method is extensively tested in six distinct large German river basins and cross validated in 222 additional basins in Germany. We conclude that land surface temperature calibration outperforms random drawn parameter sets, which could be meaningful for calibrating hydrologic models in ungauged locations. A combined calibration with Q and Ts reduces the root mean squared error in the predicted evapotranspiration by 8{\%} compared to flux tower observations but reduces the NSEs of the streamflow predictions by 6{\%} on average for the six large basins. Our results show that patterns of Ts better constrain model parameters when considered in a calibration next to Q, which finally reduces parametric uncertainty.},

abstract = {The USDA-Agricultural Research Service's Experimental Watershed Network grew from Dust Bowl era efforts of the Soil Conservation Service in the mid 1930's with the establishment of watersheds in three States; one of which is still in operation. In the mid-50's five centers with intensively instrumented watersheds at the scale of 100 to 700 km2 were established. Primary network research objectives were to quantify the field-scale and downstream effects of conservation practices and develop rainfall-runoff relationships for design of water conservation structures. USDA-ARS has operated over 600 watersheds in its history and continues to operate roughly 120 watersheds, many of which consist of gauged subwatersheds nested within larger gauged watersheds to enable investigation of scaling. With passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, research objectives have evolved to add a variety of observations relevant to the water quality issues in their respective regions resulting in a more diverse, but less homogeneous network. The core instrumentation and related long record of high-quality observations have led to initiation of a series of multi-location projects to examine trends and directions of these observations across the network. As a result of their long history, intensive monitoring, and well described processes, the USDA-ARS watersheds have been used extensively in the development and validation of numerous watershed models. In addition, they served, and continue to serve as validation sites for aircraft and satellite based remotely sensed instruments. Many of the USDA-ARS Experimental Watersheds have now joined the Long-Term Agro-ecosystem Research Network (LTAR) (Maddox, 2013). This presentation will review major activities and advances derived from the network in addition to discussing some lessons learned in the long-term operation of a national scale network through its evolution from analog to digital instrumentation and internet accessibility.},

abstract = {As water is required for producing hydropower, and subsequently the water balance is changed for downstream areas, the linking of hydrological and energy models is needed to properly address the interactions among them. In this study, volume-depth-based water storage estimation models were proposed for individual lakes and reservoirs in the Iberian Peninsula using the 30-year GlobalWater Surface dataset and reservoir morphometry methodology which enables to evaluate reservoirs where data were not available before. The models were subsequently implemented within the new hydropower model called LISENGY that provides the first comprehensive assessment of the temporal and spatial dynamics of water storage, water depth and hydropower production in the Iberian Peninsula. The LISENGY model was coupled with the distributed LISFLOOD hydrological model. The seasonal and interannual changes in energy production were assessed for 168 studied reservoirs with diverse morphometries, which is unique. Conical, concave and convex regression reservoir relationships were distinguished, and optimized turbine discharge and power production were computed. A 10-year water-energy linked system for the 2007-2016 period has been established for the Iberian Peninsula which was not available before. The results showed that it is possible to connect those two models and that the timing and magnitude of simulated storage were well reproduced. The study represents the first step towards integrated pan-European water-energy modeling. Future climate scenarios and energy demands are to be fed into the linked model system to evaluate expected future hydropower generation and possible water scarcity issues.},

abstract = {This study develops a novel approach for modelling and examining the impacts of time-space land-use changes on hydrological components. The approach uses an empirical land-use change allocation model (CLUE-s) and a distributed hydrological model (DHSVM) to examine various land-use change scenarios in the Wu-Tu watershed in northern Taiwan. The study also uses a generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation approach to quantify the parameter uncertainty of the distributed hydrological model. The results indicate that various land-use policies-such as no change, dynamic change and simultaneous change-have different levels of impact on simulating the spatial distributions of hydrological components in the watershed study. Peak flow rates under simultaneous and dynamic land-use changes are 5.71{\%} and 2.77{\%}, respectively, greater than the rate under the no land-use change scenario. Using dynamic land-use changes to assess the effect of land-use changes on hydrological components is more practical and feasible than using simultaneous land-use change and no land-use change scenarios. Furthermore, land-use change is a spatial dynamic process that can lead to significant changes in the distributions of ground water and soil moisture. The spatial distributions of land-use changes influence hydrological processes, such as the ground water level of whole areas, particularly in the downstream watershed.

abstract = {Modelling strategies for predicting the potential impacts of climate change on the natural distribution of species have often focused on the characterization of a species' bioclimate envelope. A number of recent critiques have questioned the validity of this approach by pointing to the many factors other than climate that play an important part in determin- ing species distributions and the dynamics of distribution changes. Such factors include biotic interactions, evolu- tionary change and dispersal ability. This paper reviews and evaluates criticisms of bioclimate envelope models and dis- cusses the implications of these criticisms for the different modelling strategies employed. It is proposed that, although the complexity of the natural system presents fundamental limits to predictive modelling, the bioclimate envelope approach can provide a useful first approximation as to the potentially dramatic impact of climate change on biodiversity. However, it is stressed that the spatial scale at which these models are applied is of fundamental importance, and that model results should not be interpreted without due consider- ation of the limitations involved. A hierarchical modelling framework is proposed through which some of these limita- tions can be addressed within a broader, scale-dependent context.},

Comparison is made with eight other well-known model codes with respect to development stage and code dissemination among researchers and practitioners. Finally, the scientific developments and disputes on physically-based distributed modelling are discussed and the future perspectives outlined. The SHE venture has resulted in significant contributions to hydrological science, both in terms of model codes and new scientific insight. The fundamental scientific problems related to the inability to incorporate local scale spatial heterogeneity, scaling and uncertainty that were formulated are fundamentally still unresolved. Thus, in spite of the original visions, the hydrological community has not yet witnessed a model that in a universal sense (i.e. at all scales and for all internal variables) simulates accurate results for the right reasons. Instead, much of the scientific progress achieved during the recent years has dealt with how to live with these recognized problems.},

abstract = {One of the several methods in estimating flood quantiles in ungauged or data-scarce watersheds is regional frequency analysis. Amongst the approaches to regional frequency analysis, different clustering techniques have been proposed to determine hydrologically homogeneous regions in the literature. Recently, Self-Organization feature Map (SOM), a modern hydroinformatic tool, has been applied in several studies for clustering watersheds. However, further studies are still needed with SOM on the interpretation of SOM output map for identifying hydrologically homogeneous regions. In this study, two-level SOM and three clustering methods (fuzzy c-mean, K-mean, and Ward's Agglomerative hierarchical clustering) are applied in an effort to identify hydrologically homogeneous regions in Mazandaran province watersheds in the north of Iran, and their results are compared with each other. Firstly the SOM is used to form a two-dimensional feature map. Next, the output nodes of the SOM are clustered by using unified distance matrix algorithm and three clustering methods to form regions for flood frequency analysis. The heterogeneity test indicates the four regions achieved by the two-level SOM and Ward approach after adjustments are sufficiently homogeneous. The results suggest that the combination of SOM and Ward is much better than the combination of either SOM and FCM or SOM and K-mean. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Given the rate of projected environmental change for the 21st century, urgent adaptation and mitigation measures are required to slow down the on-going erosion of biodiversity. Even though increasing evidence shows that recent human-induced environmental changes have already triggered species' range shifts, changes in phenology and species' extinctions, accurate projections of species' responses to future environmental changes are more difficult to ascertain. This is problematic, since there is a growing awareness of the need to adopt proactive conservation planning measures using forecasts of species' responses to future environmental changes. There is a substantial body of literature describing and assessing the impacts of various scenarios of climate and land-use change on species' distributions. Model predictions include a wide range of assumptions and limitations that are widely acknowledged but compromise their use for developing reliable adaptation and mitigation strategies for biodiversity. Indeed, amongst the most used models, few, if any, explicitly deal with migration processes, the dynamics of population at the "trailing edge" of shifting populations, species' interactions and the interaction between the effects of climate and land-use. In this review, we propose two main avenues to progress the understanding and prediction of the different processes occurring on the leading and trailing edge of the species' distribution in response to any global change phenomena. Deliberately focusing on plant species, we first explore the different ways to incorporate species' migration in the existing modelling approaches, given data and knowledge limitations and the dual effects of climate and land-use factors. Secondly, we explore the mechanisms and processes happening at the trailing edge of a shifting species' distribution and how to implement them into a modelling approach. We finally conclude this review with clear guidelines on how such modelling improvements will benefit conservation strategies in a changing world. {\textcopyright} 2007 R{\"{u}}bel Foundation, ETH Z{\"{u}}rich.},

abstract = {The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been used for assessing the impact of land cover and land management changes on water resources for a wide range of scales and environmental conditions across the globe. However, originally designed for temperate regions, SWAT must be critically examined for its appropriate use in tropical watersheds. One major concern is the simulation of perennial tropical vegetation due to the absence of dormancy. While for temperate regions SWAT uses dormancy to terminate growing seasons of trees and perennials, seasonality in the tropics (wet and dry season) can only be represented by defining date or heat unit specific "plant" and "kill" operations which are fixed for every year of simulation. In this paper, we discuss these shortcomings and present an alternative approach to automatically initiate annual growing cycles based on changes in soil moisture. Furthermore, we propose a logistic leaf area index (LAI) decline function which approaches a user-defined minimum LAI instead of using the default function, which is not considering the minimum LAI. The modified SWAT model was tested based on MODIS LAI and evapotranspiration data for the Santa Maria/Torto watershed in Central Brazil, covered mostly by Cerrado (savanna) vegetation. Our model results show that the modified model can reasonably represent seasonal dynamics of the Cerrado biome. However, since the proposed changes are process-based but also allow flexible model settings (e.g. the beginning of growing cycles based on a soil moisture threshold adjustable for plant/land cover types), the modified plant growth module should be useful for large parts of the model community. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Objetivo:
Modificar el m{\'{o}}dulo de crecimiento de la vegetaci{\'{o}}n de SWAT para adaptarlo a su din{\'{a}}mica en climas tropicales. El nuevo modelo se aplica en una cuenca de Brasil con vegetaci{\'{o}}n caracter{\'{i}}stica 'cerrado'.

Teor{\'{i}}as e hip{\'{o}}tesis:
Se parte del modelo SWAT2009 y se comentan sus defectos a la hora de simular la din{\'{a}}mica de la vegetaci{\'{o}}n tropical. 
El modelo de crecimiento de la vegetaci{\'{o}}n se modifica:
- Se crea un nuevo algoritmo que permite establecer de forma variable el inicio de la {\'{e}}poca de crecimiento en funci{\'{o}}n de la humedad del suelo en las dos capas superiores de suelo, en vez de en funci{\'{o}}n de la temperatura.
- Se modifica la tasa de declive de LAI para que tenga una forma sigmoidal y llegue a un valor m{\'{i}}nimo calibrable (en vez de una reducci{\'{o}}n lineal hasta 0).

Metodolog{\'{i}}a:
Se calibra el modelo secuencialmente para la LAI, ET y el caudal.
Los datos de LAI y ET necesarios para la calibraci{\'{o}}n/validaci{\'{o}}n se extraen de MODIS. Se comparan los valores satelitales con mediciones de campo y se observa que es necesario aplicar un filtro de alta frecuencia sobre los datos de LAI debido al ruido generado por nubes convectivas.

Resultados:
Calibraci{\'{o}}n LAI y ET:
- Se minusvalora LAI en comparaci{\'{o}}n con los datos de campo.
- ET es sobrevalorado para el tipo de vegetaci{\'{o}}n "mata" durante la estaci{\'{o}}n de lluvias y minusvalorado para "cerrado" en la estaci{\'{o}}n seca.
- En general, se consideran adecuados los datos de MODIS.

Rendimiento del modelo SWAT modificado:

@article{Mulligan1998,
abstract = {The climate of the Mediterranean is marginal for many of the economic activities upon which the people of the region depend. Part of this marginality stems from the high inter-annual and medium-term variability in climate. This paper examines the impact of climatic variability on hydrology and vegetation cover using the PATTERN ecosystem model. Significant inter-annual and medium-term variability in the components of the hydrological budget and in vegetation properties and process is apparent in the results. An examination of the variability of soil erosion which results from this variable hydrology and vegetation cover, indicates the temporally erratic nature of erosion events, the tendency for most erosion to occur in very few extreme events, and the dynamic response of erosion to climatic variability. The results also indicate the dependence of erosion on the type of vegetation cover and vegetation response to climatic variability. I conclude with the observation that the majority of significant soil erosion events in Castilla La Mancha (CLM) - site of the EFEDA I and EFEDA II research projects - occur as a result of extreme precipitation events rather than slow progressive land degradation. In this way, soil erosion can be a poor indicator of land degradation. Badlands are the relic of past climatic extremes and not necessarily an indicator of present-day desertification.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the use of the vegetative state of natural covers as an indicator of soil moisture conditions at the end of the dry season in order to evaluate the cumulative effect of the hydrological regime. To achieve this, the three major vegetation covers in a mountainous semiarid environment in southern Spain were selected. Temporal and spatial trends of NDVI from Landsat-TM images were computed and related to the different hydrological patterns of variables in the study site, which were obtained with the hydrological WiMMed model. The heterogeneity in the hydrological behavior during the study period (914.5 mm of annual rainfall in the wettest year (2009-2010) and 284.4 mm in the driest year (2004-2005)) was reflected in the annual differences in NDVI values with steady mean NDVI values in coniferous vegetation (0.5-0.6) and more variable values in scrub cover. Both Correlation Analysis and Principal Component Analysis showed correlations among the different states of the vegetation cover, the variables involved in the soil water balance and those related to the snow dynamics of the antecedent year. Exponential fits were obtained between the mean annual soil water content and NDVI values with Pearson r2coefficients of over 0.7 in scrub cover. In certain years, the best fits were also found in scrub cover with r2values of up to 0.9. These results demonstrate the relationship between soil water content, the vigor of the natural vegetation and the hydrological characteristics of the antecedent year. The expressions obtained may serve to adjust the soil water content at the beginning of a hydrological year and to use the scrub cover as an indicator of the soil water balance in the area for a given year. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Hrachowitz2014,
abstract = {Hydrological models frequently suffer from limited predictive power despite adequate calibra- tion performances. This can indicate insufficient representations of the underlying processes. Thus, ways are sought to increase model consistency while satisfying the contrasting priorities of increased model com- plexity and limited equifinality. In this study, the value of a systematic use of hydrological signatures and expert knowledge for increasing model consistency was tested. It was found that a simple conceptual model, constrained by four calibration objective functions, was able to adequately reproduce the hydro- graph in the calibration period. The model, however, could not reproduce a suite of hydrological signatures, indicating a lack of model consistency. Subsequently, testing 11 models, model complexity was increased in a stepwise way and counter-balanced by ‘‘prior constraints,'' inferred from expert knowledge to ensure a model which behaves well with respect to the modeler's perception of the system. We showed that, in spite of unchanged calibration performance, the most complex model setup exhibited increased performance in the independent test period and skill to better reproduce all tested signatures, indicating a better system representation. The results suggest that a model may be inadequate despite good performance with respect to multiple calibration objectives and that increasing model complexity, if counter-balanced by prior constraints, can significantly increase predictive performance of a model and its skill to reproduce hydrolog- ical signatures. The results strongly illustrate the need to balance automated model calibration with a more expert-knowledge-driven strategy of constraining models.},

The principal discovery is that in a simple network of adaptive physical elements which receives signals from a primary event space, the signal representations are automatically mapped onto a set of output responses in such a way that the responses acquire the same topological order as that of the primary events. In other words, a principle has been discovered which facilitates the automatic formation of topologically correct maps of features of observable events. The basic self-organizing system is a one- or two-dimensional array of processing units resembling a network of threshold-logic units, and characterized by short-range lateral feedback between neighbouring units. Several types of computer simulations are used to demonstrate the ordering process as well as the conditions under which it fails. {\textcopyright} 1982 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Understanding drivers of aboveground net primary production (ANPP) has long been a goal of ecology. Decades of investigation have shown total annual precipitation to be an important determinant of ANPP within and across ecosystems. Recently a few studies at individual sites have shown precipitation during specific seasons of the year can more effectively predict ANPP. Here we determined whether seasonal or total precipitation better predicted ANPP across a range of terrestrial ecosystems, from deserts to forests, using long-term data from 36 plant communities. We also determined whether ANPP responses were dependent on ecosystem type or plant functional group. We found that seasonal precipitation generally explained ANPP better than total precipitation. Precipitation in multiple parts of the growing season often correlated with ANPP, but rarely interacted with each other. Surprisingly, the amount of variation explained by seasonal precipitation was not correlated with ecosystem type or plant functional group. Overall, examining seasonal precipitation can significantly improve ANPP predictions across a broad range of ecosystems and plant types, with implications for understanding current and future ANPP variation. Further work examining precipitation timing relative to species phenology may further improve our ability to predict ANPP, especially in response to climate change.},

abstract = {IMproving PRedictions and management of hydrological EXtremes (IMPREX) was a European Union Horizon 2020 project that ran from September 2015 to September 2019. IMPREX aimed to improve society's ability to anticipate and respond to future extreme hydrological events in Europe across a variety of uses in the water-related sectors (flood forecasting, drought risk assessment, agriculture, navigation, hydropower and water supply utilities). Through the engagement with stakeholders and continuous feedback between model outputs and water applications, progress was achieved in better understanding the way hydrological predictions can be useful to (and operationally incorporated into) problem-solving in the water sector. The work and discussions carried out during the project nurtured further reflections toward a common vision for hydrological prediction. In this article, we summarized the main findings of the IMPREX project within a broader overview of hydrological prediction, providing a vision for improving such predictions. In so doing, we first presented a synopsis of hydrological and weather forecasting, with a focus on medium-range to seasonal scales of prediction for increased preparedness. Second, the lessons learned from IMPREX were discussed. The key findings were the gaps highlighted in the global observing system of the hydrological cycle, the degree of accuracy of hydrological models and the techniques of post-processing to correct biases, the origin of seasonal hydrological skill in Europe and user requirements of hydrometeorological forecasts to ensure their appropriate use in decision-making models and practices. Last, a vision for how to improve these forecast systems/products in the future was expounded, including advancing numerical weather and hydrological models, improved earth monitoring and more frequent interaction between forecasters and users to tailor the forecasts to applications. We conclude that if these improvements can be implemented in the coming years, earth system and hydrological modelling will become more skillful, thus leading to socioeconomic benefits for the citizens of Europe and beyond.},

abstract = {Rising global temperature has put increasing pressure on understanding the linkage between atmospheric warming and the occurrence of natural hazards. While the Paris Agreement has set the ambitious target to limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to preindustrial levels, scientists are urged to explore scenarios for different warming thresholds and quantify ranges of socioeconomic impact. In this work, we present a framework to estimate the economic damage and population affected by river floods at global scale. It is based on a modeling cascade involving hydrological, hydraulic and socioeconomic impact simulations, and makes use of state-of-the-art global layers of hazard, exposure and vulnerability at 1-km grid resolution. An ensemble of seven high-resolution global climate projections based on Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 is used to derive streamflow simulations in the present and in the future climate. Those were analyzed to assess the frequency and magnitude of river floods and their impacts under scenarios corresponding to 1.5°C, 2°C, and 4°C global warming. Results indicate a clear positive correlation between atmospheric warming and future flood risk at global scale. At 4°C global warming, countries representing more than 70{\%} of the global population and global gross domestic product will face increases in flood risk in excess of 500{\%}. Changes in flood risk are unevenly distributed, with the largest increases in Asia, U.S., and Europe. In contrast, changes are statistically not significant in most countries in Africa and Oceania for all considered warming levels.},

abstract = {This paper provides a new methodological approach to analyse secular patterns of flooding (magnitude and frequency) from sedimentary evidence (palaeofloods), taking into account changes in channel geometry, and their links to historical environmental changes and the inherent social and demographic evolution within the catchment. A case study analysis was focused in Rambla de la Viuda (drainage area of 1500 km2) whose stream flow is related to extreme rainfalls. A 500 years sedimentary archive was reconstructed from eight stratigraphic profiles comprising continuous sequences of slackwater flood deposits interbedded with episodic colluvial and edaphic horizons. Discharge estimates associated to sedimentary flood evidences were obtained from one-dimensional hydraulic modelling. The stratigraphic units were sampled to characterise their geochemical and paleobotanical (phytoliths) contents. Palaeoflood chronology was obtained from radiocarbon and luminescence (OSL) dating, supported by documentary data (written historical documents). A high frequency and high magnitude palaeoflood period took place during the 15th-middle 16th century, which seem to correlate in time with general wetter conditions. Three short-term environment stability conditions (land use and climatic) also made possible the development of three paleosols. The lowest flood magnitude and discharges in the sedimentary record was found between the mid-17th to mid-18th centuries, under prevailing drier environmental conditions. Episodic high magnitude flooding took place at late 18th century, correlating in time with palaeovegetation and geochemical evidences of important changes on land use (deforestation and grazing). Poorer developed soils were found at upper stratigraphic sequences (19th century) characterised by thick units of colluvium deposits, usually culminating sequences of short-lived continuous slackwater flood units. Despite of the potential human influence (land-use) on soil hydrology, the long-term behaviour of high magnitude floods ({\textgreater}1000 m3 s-1) has been stationary over the last 500 years.},

abstract = {Previous work has shown that a one-dimensional water content-based finite difference algorithm can compared to similar pressure-based algorithms. The usefulness of the water content-based method is limited, however, since it cannot be applied to saturated soils. In this paper we develop two new methods which retain the advantages of water content-based methods while still permitting fully saturated conditions. In the first method we define a new variable for the transformed Richards equation which has the characteristics of water content when soil is unsaturated and of pressure when soil is at or near saturation. In addition to the transformed Richards' equation method, an improved pressure-based method which uses flux updating is presented. Both methods are implemented in algorithms using a preconditioned conjugate gradient method equation solver. The performance of the algorithms is compared to that of an algorithm based on a mixed form of Richards' equation using modified Picard iteration. Two test cases are examined. The first test case examines two-dimensional infiltration into very dry heterogeneous soil which remains unsaturated throughout the simulation period. The second test case examines a two-dimensional developing perched water table. Results indicate that the new methods retain the advantages of the water content-based method for fully unsaturated heterogeneous problems while allowing for fully saturated conditions. For the unsaturated problem the new algorithms were from !6 to 59 times faster than the algorithm based on the mixed form of Richards' equation using modified Picard iteration. For the saturated problem the new algorithms were from 6 to 25 times faster than the mixed base algorithm. Results also indicate that the performance of the mixed base algorithm could be significantly improved if a more effective adaptive time step were developed.},

Satellite remote sensing data may be able to fill this gap, but require novel methodologies to exploit their spatiotemporal information that could potentially be incorporated into model calibration and validation frameworks. The present study tackles this problem by suggesting an automatic calibration procedure, based on the empirical orthogonal function, for distributed ecohydrological daily models. The procedure is tested with the support of remote sensing data in a data-scarce environment - the upper Ewaso Ngiro river basin in Kenya. In the present application, the TETIS-VEG model is calibrated using only NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data derived from MODIS. The results demonstrate that (1) satellite data of vegetation dynamics can be used to calibrate and validate ecohydrological models in water-controlled and datascarce regions, (2) the model calibrated using only satellite data is able to reproduce both the spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics and the observed discharge at the outlet and (3) the proposed automatic calibration methodology works satisfactorily and it allows for a straightforward incorporation of spatio-temporal data into the calibration and validation framework of a model.},

abstract = {Deep learning (DL), a new generation of artificial neural network research, has transformed industries, daily lives, and various scientific disciplines in recent years. DL represents significant progress in the ability of neural networks to automatically engineer problem-relevant features and capture highly complex data distributions. I argue that DL can help address several major new and old challenges facing research in water sciences such as interdisciplinarity, data discoverability, hydrologic scaling, equifinality, and needs for parameter regionalization. This review paper is intended to provide water resources scientists and hydrologists in particular with a simple technical overview, transdisciplinary progress update, and a source of inspiration about the relevance of DL to water. The review reveals that various physical and geoscientific disciplines have utilized DL to address data challenges, improve efficiency, and gain scientific insights. DL is especially suited for information extraction from image-like data and sequential data. Techniques and experiences presented in other disciplines are of high relevance to water research. Meanwhile, less noticed is that DL may also serve as a scientific exploratory tool. A new area termed AI neuroscience, where scientists interpret the decision process of deep networks and derive insights, has been born. This budding subdiscipline has demonstrated methods including correlation-based analysis, inversion of network-extracted features, reduced-order approximations by interpretable models, and attribution of network decisions to inputs. Moreover, DL can also use data to condition neurons that mimic problem-specific fundamental organizing units, thus revealing emergent behaviors of these units. Vast opportunities exist for DL to propel advances in water sciences.},

abstract = {Climate change is expected to impact discharge and sediment yield in watersheds. The purpose of this paper is to assess the potential impacts of climate change on water discharge and sediment yield for the Yi'an watershed of the black soil region, northeastern China, based on the newly released Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) during 2071–2099. For this purpose, the TETIS model was implemented to simulate the hydrological and sedimentological responses to climate change. The model calibration (1971–1977) and validation (1978–1987) performances were rated as satisfactory. The modeling results for the four RCP scenarios relative to the control scenario under the same land use configuration indicated an increase in discharge of 16.3{\%} (RCP 2.6), 14.3{\%} (RCP 4.5), 36.7{\%} (RCP 6.0) and 71.4{\%} (RCP 8.5) and an increase in the sediment yield of 16.5{\%} (RCP 2.6), 32.4{\%} (RCP 4.5), 81.8{\%} (RCP 6.0) and 170{\%} (RCP 8.5). This implies that the negative impact of climate change on sediment yield is generally greater than that on discharge. At the monthly scale, both discharge and sediment yield increased dramatically in April to June and August to September. A more vigorous hydrological cycle and an increase in high values of sediment yield are also expected. These changes in annual discharge and sediment yield were closely linked with changes in precipitation, whereas monthly changes in late spring and autumn were mainly related to temperature. This study highlights the possible adverse impact of climate change on discharge and sediment yield in the black soil region of northeastern China and could provide scientific basis for adaptive management.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new publicly available high-resolution daily precipitation gridded dataset developed for peninsular Spain and the Balearic islands using 2756 quality-controlled stations (this dataset is referred to as Spain02). The grid has a regular 0.2 degrees (approx. 20 km) horizontal resolution and spans the period from 1950 to 2003. Different interpolation methods were tested using a cross-validation approach to compare the resulting interpolated values against station data: kriging, angular distance weighting, and thin plane splines. Finally, the grid was produced applying the kriging method in a two-step process. First, the occurrence was interpolated using a binary kriging and, in a second step, the amounts were interpolated by applying ordinary kriging to the occurrence outcomes. This procedure is similar to the interpolation method used to generate the E-OBS gridded datathe state-of-the-art publicly available high-resolution daily dataset for Europewhich was used in this study for comparison purposes. Climatological statistics and extreme value indicators from the resulting grid were compared to those from the 25 km E-OBS dataset using the observed station records as a reference. Spain02 faithfully reproduces climatological features such as annual precipitation occurrence, accumulated amounts and variability, whereas E-OBS has some deficiencies in the southern region. When focusing on upper percentiles and other indicators of extreme precipitation regimes, Spain02 accurately reproduces the amount and spatial distribution of the observed extreme indicators, whereas E-OBS data present serious limitations over Spain due to the sparse data used in this region. As extreme values are more sensitive to interpolation, the dense station coverage of this new data set was crucial to get an accurate reproduction of the extremes.

abstract = {Monitoring continental precipitation over Europe with high resolution (2 km, 15 min) has been possible since the operational production of the OPERA composites from the European weather radar networks. The OPERA data are the essential input to a hazard assessment tool for identifying localized rainfall-induced flash floods at European scale, and their quality determines the performance of the tool. This paper analyses the OPERA data quality during the warm seasons of 2015–2017 by comparing the estimated rainfall accumulations with the SYNOP rain gauge records over Europe. To compensate the OPERA underestimation, a simple spatially-variable bias adjustment method has been applied. The long-term comparison between the OPERA and gauge point daily rainfall accumulations at the gauge locations shows the benefit of the bias adjustment. Additionally, the daily monitoring shows gradual improvement of the OPERA data year by year. The impact of the quality of the OPERA data for effective flash flood identification is demonstrated for the case of the flash floods that occurred from 29 May to 3 June 2016 in central Europe.},

abstract = {Several attempts to estimate the suspended load and the sediment deficit caused by the reservoirs have been carried out in the lower Ebro River. However, existing data are scarce, scattered along time and space, and obtained under different hydrological conditions and methods. This study estimate the presently suspended sediment load of the lowermost Ebro River, using field data collected during three consecutive years at different verticals of a cross-section and covering a large range of discharges. In addition, the daily suspended load for the last 30 years has been reconstructed and validated. The suspended load for the period 2007-2010 has been estimated at 84,000 t/y (±9800 t) while 99,500 t/y (±18,000 t) accounted for 1981-2010 period. Approximately, 80{\%} of the total suspended load (period 2007-2010) has been transferred as inorganic load. A significant seasonal variability in the total (organic and inorganic) suspended load is observed. Therefore, two distinct cycling phases in the suspended load production and transfer has been inferred: an initial phase in which the sediment was prepared into the basin followed by a second phase in which most of the load was transferred downstream. These two phases are governed by the relative temporal location of the natural floods and the river regulation from the reservoirs. Nowadays, less than 1{\%} of suspended load is transferred compared to pre-dams construction. The current levels of suspended load are very low and not enough to supply the material needed to maintain the delta elevation and avoid coastal retreat. The sustainability of the lower Ebro River and its delta could only be guaranteed by the implementation of a new reservoir management concept with the allocation of an appropriate liquid and solid flow regime.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract. Climate change has resulted in more frequent occurrences of extreme events, such as flooding and heavy snowfall, which can have a significant impact on densely populated or industrialised areas. Numerical models are used to simulate and predict these extreme events, enabling informed decision-making and planning to minimise human casualties and to protect costly infrastructure. LISFLOOD is an integrated hydrological model underpinning the European Flood Awareness System and Global Flood Awareness System (EFAS and GloFAS, respectively), developed by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS). The CEMS{\_}SurfaceFields{\_}2022 dataset is a new set of high-resolution surface fields at 1 and 3 arcmin resolution (approximately 2 and 6 km at the Equator, respectively) based on a wide variety of high-resolution and up-to-date data sources. The 1 arcmin fields cover Europe, while the surface fields at 3 arcmin cover the global land surface (excluding Antarctica). The dataset encompasses (i) catchment morphology and river networks, (ii) land use, (iii) vegetation cover type and properties, (iv) soil properties, (v) lake information, and (vi) water demand. This paper details the complete workflow used to generate the CEMS{\_}SurfaceFields{\_}2022 fields, including the data sources and methodology. Whilst created together with upgrades to the open source LISFLOOD code, the CEMS{\_}SurfaceFields{\_}2022 fields can be used independently for a wide range of applications, including as input to hydrological, Earth system, or environmental models or for carrying out general analyses across spatial scales, ranging from global and regional levels to local levels (especially useful for regions outside Europe), expected to improve the accuracy, detail and realism of applications.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

El estudio del impacto de las actividades humanas sobre la din{\'{a}}mica del paisaje en el {\'{u}}ltimo siglo y medio ha revelado cambios espectaculares en la estructura y distribuci{\'{o}}n de la vegetaci{\'{o}}n, tanto en el piso montano como en el subalpino y, consecuentemente, cambios en la generaci{\'{o}}n de escorrent{\'{i}}a, la intensidad de la erosi{\'{o}}n del suelo y las fuentes de sedimento, cualquiera que sea la escala espacial a la que se contempla el problema. De forma general puede afirmarse que a mediados del siglo XIX se alcanza la m{\'{a}}xima presi{\'{o}}n sobre el territorio, cultiv{\'{a}}ndose todas las laderas posibles hasta una altitud aproximada de 1650 m s.n.m. y empleando frecuentemente el fuego para limitar la expansi{\'{o}}n de matorrales en zonas de pastos, lo que dio lugar a intensos procesos de erosi{\'{o}}n y degradaci{\'{o}}n del suelo, y al desarrollo de r{\'{i}}os trenzados con una elevada torrencialidad. Posteriormente, el abandono de tierras de cultivo desde comienzos del siglo XX (y, en especial, desde la d{\'{e}}cada de 1960) y el descenso de la presi{\'{o}}n ganadera han favorecido la revegetaci{\'{o}}n de las antiguas {\'{a}}reas de cultivo y pastos bien por avance de formaciones naturales de matorral y bosque, bien por la reforestaci{\'{o}}n artificial de extensas laderas, ascendiendo el treeline en el piso subalpino, en este {\'{u}}ltimo caso ayudado adem{\'{a}}s por el incremento de la temperatura. Las consecuencias m{\'{a}}s destacadas de esta evoluci{\'{o}}n han sido: (i) el descenso sostenido del caudal de los r{\'{i}}os pirenaicos desde la d{\'{e}}cada de 1970 debido al aumento de la evapotranspiraci{\'{o}}n; (ii) la contracci{\'{o}}n espacial de las {\'{a}}reas fuente de sedimento; (iii) la creciente desconexi{\'{o}}n entre laderas y cauces; (iv) el peso decreciente de la nieve en el r{\'{e}}gimen de los r{\'{i}}os pirenaicos, con un adelanto en la ocurrencia del momento de aguas altas primaverales; (v) los cambios en la din{\'{a}}mica de llenado de los embalses que han obligado a introducir nuevos patrones de gesti{\'{o}}n de los embalses; y (vi) la incisi{\'{o}}n de los cauces fluviales en su propia llanura aluvial.

abstract = {The political pressure on the scientific community to provide medium to long term flood forecasts has increased in the light of recent flooding events in Europe. Such demands can be met by a system consisting of three different model components (weather forecast, rainfall runoff forecast and flood inundation forecast) which are all liable to considerable uncertainty in the input, output and model parameters. Thus, an understanding of cascaded uncertainties is a necessary requirement to provide robust predictions. In this paper, 10-day ahead rainfall forecasts, consisting of one deterministic, one control and 50 ensemble forecasts, are fed into a rainfallrunoff model (LisFlood) for which parameter uncertainty is represented by six different parameter sets identified through a Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) analysis and functional hydrograph classification. The runoff of these 52 * 6 realisations form the input to a flood inundation model (LisFlood-FP) which acknowledges uncertainty by utilising ten different sets of roughness coefficients identified using the same GLUE methodology. Likelihood measures for each parameter set computed on historical data are used to give uncertain predictions of flow hydrographs as well as spatial inundation extent. This analysis demonstrates that a full uncertainty analysis of such an integrated system is limited mainly by computer power as well as by how well the rainfall predictions represent potential future conditions. However, these restrictions may be overcome or lessened in the future and this paper establishes a computationally feasible methodological approach to the uncertainty cascade problem.},

abstract = {Lakes and reservoirs are crucial elements of the hydrological and biochemical cycle and are a valuable resource for hydropower, domestic and industrial water use, and irrigation. Although their monitoring is crucial in times of increased pressure on water resources by both climate change and human interventions, publically available datasets of lake and reservoir levels and volumes are scarce. Within this study, a time series of variation in lake and reservoir volume between 1984 and 2015 were analysed for 137 lakes over all continents by combining the JRC Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset and the satellite altimetry database DAHITI. The GSW dataset is a highly accurate surface water dataset at 30 m resolution compromising the whole L1T Landsat 5, 7 and 8 archive, which allowed for detailed lake area calculations globally over a very long time period using Google Earth Engine. Therefore, the estimates in water volume fluctuations using the GSW dataset are expected to improve compared to current techniques as they are not constrained by complex and computationally intensive classification procedures. Lake areas and water levels were combined in a regression to derive the hypsometry relationship (dh dA) for all lakes. Nearly all lakes showed a linear regression, and 42 {\%} of the lakes showed a strong linear relationship with a R 2 {\textgreater} 0.8, an average R 2 of 0.91 and a standard deviation of 0.05. For these lakes and for lakes with a nearly constant lake area (coefficient of variation {\textless} 0.008), volume variations were calculated. Lakes with a poor linear relationship were not considered. Reasons for low R 2 values were found to be (1) a nearly constant lake area, (2) winter ice coverage and (3) a predominant lack of data within the GSW dataset for those lakes. Lake volume estimates were validated for 18 lakes in the US, Spain, Australia and Africa using in situ volume time series, and gave an excellent Pearson correlation coefficient of on average 0.97 with a standard deviation of 0.041, and a normalized RMSE of 7.42 {\%}. These results show a high potential for measuring lake volume dynamics using a pre-classified GSW dataset, which easily allows the method to be scaled up to an extensive global volumetric dataset. This dataset will not only provide a historical lake and reservoir volume variation record, but will also help to improve our understanding of the behaviour of lakes and reservoirs and their representation in (large-scale) hydrological models.},
annote = {Summary
The paper presents a methodology to combine 2 satellite products (lake area and lake altimetry) to first derive the hypsometric curve of the lakes and then to create a monthly time series of lake volume.

Data
* DAHITI (Database for Hydrological Time Series over Inland Waters) is the altimetry data set.
* GSW (Global Surface Water) is a data set of surface water coverage from 1984 to 2015. Out of the original data, they derived monthly time series of lake area.

Methods
They assume that the relation between lake area and lake level is linear. This holds for some of the lakes they study, but for others they discovered that there's very little variation in area, so they considered them as constant area.
Once the hypsometric curve is known, the reservoir volume can be computed either using area or altimetry data.

Results
The 137 lakes they studied were divided in three groups:
* 42 of constant area.
* 58 of varying area and good performance (R2 {\textgreater} 0.8).
* 37 of varying area and poor performance

For 18 lakes, they validated the estimated volume against in situ data. The skill was good in general.

Limitations
* Water level estimations for small lakes lack precision.
* No-data pixels in GSW -{\textgreater} expand it to use Sentinel, not only Landsat.
* 4 lakes showed a higher order relationship between area and level.
* The 37 lakes with poor R2 could be explained by ice, snow, cloud coverage, sensor issues.},

abstract = {Many hydrological models have been calibrated and validated using hydrographs alone. Since streamflow integrates water fluxes in space, many distributed hydrological models tend to have multiple feasible descriptions of hydrological processes. This equifinality usually leads to substantial prediction uncertainty. In this study, additional constraints – namely the spatial patterns of long-term average evapotranspiration (ET), shallow groundwater level and land cover change – were used to investigate the reduction of equifinality and prediction uncertainty in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in the Wami River basin in Tanzania. The additional constraints were used in the setup, parameter emulation and calibration of the SWAT model termed an “improved hydrological model” (IHM). The IHM was then compared against a classical hydrological model (CHM) which was also developed using the SWAT model but without additional constraints. In the calibration, the CHM used only the hydrograph, but the IHM used the hydrograph and the spatial pattern of long-term average ET as an additional constraint. The IHM produced a single, unique behavioural simulation, whereas the CHM produced many behavioural simulations that resulted in prediction uncertainty. The performance of the IHM with respect to the hydrograph was more consistent than that of the CHM, and the former clearly captured the mean behaviour of ET in the river basin. Therefore, we conclude that additional constraints substantially reduce equifinality and prediction uncertainty in a distributed hydrological model.},
annote = {Resumen
Se estudio la reducci{\'{o}}n de la equifinalidad en la calibraci{\'{o}}n del modelo SWAT al introducir en la calibraci{\'{o}}n los patrones espaciales de ET, el nivel del acu{\'{i}}fero superficial y cambios en el uso del suelo.

Datos
Precipitaci{\'{o}}n y temperatura: obervaciones y rean{\'{a}}lisis.
Aforos: datos mensuales (s{\'{o}}lo 69)
ET: MODIS

M{\'{e}}todos
CHM, classical hydrological modelling
La calibraci{\'{o}}n se hizo a partir de 9 iteraciones de 1000 simulaciones, escogidas {\'{e}}stas mediante el muestreo del hipercubo latino dentro de los rangos de cada par{\'{a}}metro. Entre cada iteraci{\'{o}}n se modifican los rangos de cada par{\'{a}}metro.
Se hace {\'{u}}nicamente calibraci{\'{o}}n temporal, es decir, comparaci{\'{o}}n con el hidrograma en la {\'{u}}nica estaci{\'{o}}n de aforo. Como criterios objetivo se utiliza el NSE y el index of volumetric fit (IVF) (cociente de volumen simulado y observado). Se consideran {\'{o}}ptimas simulaciones con NSE{\textgreater}=0.65 y 0.8{\textless}=IVF{\textless}=1.2
La incertidumbre se estima a partir del 95{\%} de certidumbre en la simulaci{\'{o}}n de los conjuntos de par{\'{a}}metros {\'{o}}ptimos. Sobre estos se calcula la media de la incertidumbre de la predicci{\'{o}}n (d), es decir, el ancho medio del rango de incertidumbre en el periodo de estudio.

IHM, improved hydrological modelling
Se a{\~{n}}aden tres restricciones espaciales:
- El patr{\'{o}}n espacial de ET media. Se utiliza para emular el patr{\'{o}}n del par{\'{a}}metro de almacenamiento en la vegetaci{\'{o}}n y para comparar el patr{\'{o}}n espacial de la ET simulada.
- El patr{\'{o}}n espacial del nivel del acu{\'{i}}fero. Se obtiene a partir de los datos satelitales de ET al final de la estaci{\'{o}}n seca. Se utiliza para emular el p{\'{a}}rametro de la profundidad cr{\'{i}}tica del acu{\'{i}}fero superficial, aquella a partir de la que hay flujo del acu{\'{i}}fero hacia la zona radicular.
- Serie de mapa anual de usos del suelo, expresados en m{\'{a}}ximo LAI. SWAT permite actualizar la proporci{\'{o}}n de los usos del suelo dentro de un HRU mediante la rutina LUP (land use updating).

Se hace una doble calibraci{\'{o}}n: temporal y espacial. La calibraci{\'{o}}n temporal es igual que para CHM, mientras que para la calibraci{\'{o}}n espacial se utiliza el coeficiente de correlaci{\'{o}}n de Pearson (R) entre el patr{\'{o}}n espacial medio de ET observado y simulado. Se consideran {\'{o}}ptimas simulaciones donde R{\textgreater}=0.7.

Resultados
Classical hydrological modelling
Se obtuvieron 80 simulaciones {\'{o}}ptimas de las 9000 simulaciones, demostrando una equifinalidad considerable. La mejor simulaci{\'{o}}n obtuvo un NSE de 0.82 y 0.58 y un IVF de 0.94 y 0.79 para calibraci{\'{o}}n y validaci{\'{o}}n, respectivamente. Es decir, hay una gran p{\'{e}}rdida de rendimiento en la validaci{\'{o}}n, lo cual denota que el modelo no representa adecuadamente la cuenca. 
CHM tiene una intertidumbre en la predicci{\'{o}}n alta (d=67m³/s). Adem{\'{a}}s, el percentil 95 s{\'{o}}lo abarca la observaci{\'{o}}n un 70{\%} del periodo observado.

Improved hydrological modelling
Se obtiene una {\'{u}}nica simulaci{\'{o}}n {\'{o}}ptima en las 9000 simulaciones. El NSE e IVF toma valores satisfactorios tanto en calibraci{\'{o}}n como validaci{\'{o}}n, si bien en el primer caso son ligeramente inferiores a CHM. El patr{\'{o}}n espacial de ET muestra un acuerdo notable (R=0.71), si bien hay outliers para valores simulados por encima de 60 mm/mes.

Distribuci{\'{o}}n del agua en el ciclo hidrol{\'{o}}gico
Se calcul{\'{o}} el agua almacenada en las distintas fases del ciclo hidrol{\'{o}}gico con ambas aproximaciones. Los resultados demuestran que ambos modelos representan cuencas con un funcionamiento muy distinto; el IHM obtiene una cuenca en la que predomina el caudal aportado por el acu{\'{i}}fero superficial, mientras que CHM una en la que el caudal est{\'{a}} regulado por el acu{\'{i}}fero profundo.

Discusi{\'{o}}n
- La inclusi{\'{o}}n de restricciones espaciales en IHM conlleva la eliminaci{\'{o}}n de la equifinalidad (una {\'{u}}nica simulaci{\'{o}}n {\'{o}}ptima). Por tanto, la inclusi{\'{o}}n de restricciones aparte del hidrograma reduce la equifinalidad.
- Ninguno de los modelos capta los picos de caudal. Esto se debe probablemente a que ni NSE ni IVF ponen el foco en los extremos.
- Si bien el rendimiento de los dos modelos es similar en la calibraci{\'{o}}n (ligeramente mejor para CHM), en la validaci{\'{o}}n s{\'{o}}lo es satisfactorio IHM
- ET es una variable crucial en el ciclo hidrol{\'{o}}gico, pues representa una amplia proporci{\'{o}}n del ciclo del agua. Su inclusi{\'{o}}n como patr{\'{o}}n espacial es vital.
- Acoplar la calibraci{\'{o}}n del hidrograma con una observaci{\'{o}}n espacial y encontrar un equilibrio entre ambas hace mucho m{\'{a}}s cre{\'{i}}ble la calibraci{\'{o}}n de un modelo distribuido.
- Los dos modelos representa cuencas de funcionamiento muy distinto. La falta de datos evita discernir cu{\'{a}}l de ellos es m{\'{a}}s correcto. Si bien, CHM tiene 80 simulaciones {\'{o}}ptimas que pueden representar funcionamientos de cuenca muy distintos.},

abstract = {Adverse consequences of floods change in time and are influenced by both natural and socio-economic trends and interactions. In Europe, previous studies of historical flood losses corrected for demographic and economic growth ('normalized') have been limited in temporal and spatial extent, leading to an incomplete representation of trends in losses over time. Here we utilize a gridded reconstruction of flood exposure in 37 European countries and a new database of damaging floods since 1870. Our results indicate that, after correcting for changes in flood exposure, there has been an increase in annually inundated area and number of persons affected since 1870, contrasted by a substantial decrease in flood fatalities. For more recent decades we also found a considerable decline in financial losses per year. We estimate, however, that there is large underreporting of smaller floods beyond most recent years, and show that underreporting has a substantial impact on observed trends.},

abstract = {We produced downscaled climatic projections (based on A1B Ipcc emission scenario) for six Italian study areas, in the framework of the Italian Agroscenari research project. The projections were analyzed in term of their impact on irrigation demand for fruit and horticultural crops in the study area of Faenza, devoted to specialized fruit cropping, and located in the Romagna sub-region, northern Italy. The climate change impacts for the period 2021-2050 on crop irrigation water needs were assessed by means of the Criteria water balance model, in the two versions available, Criteria BdP (local) and Geo (spatial) with different levels of detail. We found in general an irrigation demand increase of about +10{\%} comparing the 2021-2050 period with the reference years 1961-1990, but no substantial differences with more recent years, i.e. 1991-2008, mainly due to a projected increase in spring precipitation compensating the projected higher summer temperature and evapotranspiration.},
annote = {Objetivo:
Comparar las necesidades de riego en el escenario presente (1981-2009) y pasado (1961-1990) con respecto a un escenario futuro (2021-2050) de cambio clim{\'{a}}tico en la regi{\'{o}}n de Faenza (Italia).

M{\'{e}}todos:
Como modelo de humedad del suelo y vegetaci{\'{o}}n se usa el modelo Critera (1D) y su versi{\'{o}}n espacial Criteria Geo.

Primeramente se hace un an{\'{a}}lisis unidimensional para un tipo de cultivo, el kiwi. Se calibra el modelo con los datos meteorol{\'{o}}gicos (preciptaci{\'{o}}n y temperatura m{\'{i}}nima y m{\'{a}}xima) y observaciones de humedad de suelo y de volumen de riego. Una vez calibrado, se aplica el modelo a los escenarios pasado y futuro para comparar las necesidades de riego.

En el an{\'{a}}lisis espacial se asimilan los usos del suelo a una serie de cultivos para los que Criteria conoce sus par{\'{a}}metros y se simulan los tres periodos.

Se aplica el escenairo de emisi{\'{o}}n A1B del IPCC4. Los escenaris de cambio clim{\'{a}}tico a escala local de temperatura y preciptiaci{\'{o}}n se obtienen a trav{\'{e}}s de un downscaling stad{\'{i}}stico de los resultados de 6 AOGCM (atmosphere-ocean global circulation models). Se utiliza correlaci{\'{o}}n can{\'{o}}nica para encontrar la relaci{\'{o}}n entre los patrones espaciales entre los patrones a gran escala y a escala local. Conocida esta relaci{\'{o}}n, se utiliza un generador de clima para generar series sint{\'{e}}ticas diarias de temperatura m{\'{a}}xima y m{\'{i}}nima, y precipitaci{\'{o}}n a partir de 7 estad{\'{i}}sticos mensuales.

Resultados:
Los escenarios de cambio clim{\'{a}}tico predicen un incremento de la precipitaci{\'{o}}n en primaver y m{\'{a}}s marcado en oto{\~{n}}o, y un descenso en invierno y verano. Respecto a la temperatura, predicen un incremento en todas las estaciones, siendo {\'{e}}ste m{\'{a}}s acusado para la temperatura m{\'{a}}xima que para la m{\'{i}}nima.

El modelo unidimensional predice un aumento del 10 {\%} en la necesidad de riego en el escenario futuro frente al escenario pasado. Sin embargo, este aumento es escaso entre los escenarios presente y futuro. El escenario futuro, al contar con 300 a{\~{n}}os de simulaci{\'{o}}n en vez de 30 muestra una menor variabilidad en los resultados.

El modelo espacial predice un incremento del riego del 10 {\%} en todas los usos del suelo excepto los cultivos oto{\~{n}}ales.

El incremento del riego predicho est{\'{a}} directamente ligado con el incremento de la temperatura y el incremento de la ET que {\'{e}}ste conlleva. Adem{\'{a}}s, la reducci{\'{o}}n de la precipitaci{\'{o}}n en verano produce un aumento m{\'{a}}s marcado de las necesidades de riego en aquellos cultivos ccuya fase de crecimiento incluye la primavera y el verano. Por el contrario, el incremento de la precipitaci{\'{o}}n en primavera reduce el impacto, causando una mayor frecuencia de a{\~{n}}os con mayor riego, en vez de un incremento general del riego.

abstract = {Soil loss and sediment transport in Mediterranean areas are driven by complex non-linear processes which have been only partially understood. Distributed models can be very helpful tools for understanding the catchment-scale phenomena which lead to soil erosion and sediment transport. In this study, a modelling approach is proposed to reproduce and evaluate erosion and sediment yield processes in a Mediterranean catchment (Rambla del Poyo, Valencia, Spain). Due to the lack of sediment transport records for model calibration and validation, a detailed description of the alluvial stratigraphy infilling a check dam that drains a 12.9 km2 sub-catchment was used as indirect information of sediment yield data. These dam infill sediments showed evidences of at least 15 depositional events (floods) over the time period 1990–2009. The TETIS model, a distributed conceptual hydrological and sediment model, was coupled to the Sediment Trap Efficiency for Small Ponds (STEP) model for reproducing reservoir retention, and it was calibrated and validated using the sedimentation volume estimated for the depositional units associated with discrete runoff events. The results show relatively low net erosion rates compared to other Mediterranean catchments (0.136 Mg ha−1 yr−1), probably due to the extensive outcrops of limestone bedrock, thin soils and rather homogeneous vegetation cover. The simulated sediment production and transport rates offer model satisfactory results, further supported by in-site palaeohydrological evidences and spatial validation using additional check dams, showing the great potential of the presented data assimilation methodology for the quantitative analysis of sediment dynamics in ungauged Mediterranean basins.},

abstract = {Applications of runoff models usually rely on long and continuous runoff time series for model calibration. However, many catchments around the world are ungauged and estimating runoff for these catchments is challenging. One approach is to perform a few runoff measurements in a previously fully ungauged catchment and to constrain a runoff model by these measurements. In this study we investigated the value of such individual runoff measurements when taken at strategic points in time for applying a bucket-type runoff model (HBV) in ungauged catchments. Based on the assumption that a limited number of runoff measurements can be taken, we sought the optimal sampling strategy (i.e. when to measure the streamflow) to obtain the most informative data for constraining the runoff model. We used twenty gauged catchments across the eastern US, made the assumption that these catchments were ungauged, and applied different runoff sampling strategies. All tested strategies consisted of twelve runoff measurements within one year and ranged from simply using monthly flow maxima to a more complex selection of observation times. In each case the twelve runoff measurements were used to select 100 best parameter sets using a Monte Carlo calibration approach. Runoff simulations using these ‘informed' parameter sets were then evaluated for an independent validation period in terms of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of the hydrograph and the mean absolute relative error of the flow-duration curve. Model performance measures were normalized by relating them to an upper and a lower benchmark representing a well-informed and an uninformed model calibration. The hydrographs were best simulated with strategies including high runoff magnitudes as opposed to the flow-duration curves that were generally better estimated with strategies that captured low and mean flows. The choice of a sampling strategy covering the full range of runoff magnitudes enabled hydrograph and flow-duration curve simulations close to a well-informed model calibration. The differences among such strategies covering the full range of runoff magnitudes were small indicating that the exact choice of a strategy might be less crucial. Our study corroborates the information value of a small number of strategically selected runoff measurements for simulating runoff with a bucket-type runoff model in almost ungauged catchments.},

abstract = {The simulated outcome of a calibrated hydrologic model should be hydrologically consistent with the measured response data. Hydrologic modelers typically calibrate models to optimize residual- based goodness-of-fit measures, e.g., the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency measure, and then evaluate the obtained results with respect to hydrological signatures, e.g., the flow duration curve indices. The literature indicates that the consideration of a large number of hydrologic signatures has not been addressed in a full multiob- jective optimization context. This research develops a model calibration methodology to achieve hydrologi- cal consistency using goodness-of-fit measures, many hydrological signatures, as well as a level of acceptability for each signature. The proposed framework relies on a scoring method that transforms any hydrological signature to a calibration objective. These scores are used to develop the hydrological consis- tency metric, which is maximized to obtain hydrologically consistent parameter sets during calibration. This consistency metric is implemented in different signature-based calibration formulations that adapt the sam- pling according to hydrologic signature values. These formulations are compared with the traditional for- mulations found in the literature for seven case studies. The results reveal that Pareto dominance-based multiobjective optimization yields the highest level of consistency among all formulations. Furthermore, it is found that the choice of optimization algorithms does not affect the findings of this research. 1.},

abstract = {Accurate and scalable hydrologic models are essential building blocks of several important applications, from water resource management to timely flood warnings. However, as the climate changes, precipitation and rainfall-runoff pattern variations become more extreme, and accurate training data that can account for the resulting distributional shifts become more scarce. In this work we present a novel family of hydrologic models, called HydroNets, which leverages river network structure. HydroNets are deep neural network models designed to exploit both basin specific rainfall-runoff signals, and upstream network dynamics, which can lead to improved predictions at longer horizons. The injection of the river structure prior knowledge reduces sample complexity and allows for scalable and more accurate hydrologic modeling even with only a few years of data. We present an empirical study over two large basins in India that convincingly support the proposed model and its advantages.},
annote = {Summary
The document presents HydroNets, a deep neural network for hydrologic forecasting that is designed to include prior knowledge about the subbasin structure into the network.
They present the results of two case/studies in the Ganga and Brahmaputra basins.

Methods
HydroNets has a direct graph structure in which each of its nodes contains three submodels that combine subbasin and basin information through temporal embeddings.
The combiner model is subbasin specific. It receives the static features and the temporal embeddings of the sources (upstream catchments) and it outputs a temporal embedding.
The shared model digests the output of the combiner model, and the temporal and static features and outputs a temporal embedding.
The prediction model is subbasin-specific and predicts the water stage/discharge from the temporal embeddings of the node.

Advantages:
* It reduces the sample complexity.

Future work:
* non-linear and recurrent submodels
* Prediction of discharge
* Addition of static features.

Results
The performance of HydroNets is compared against a baseline linear model in terms of R2 and R2-persist (a version in which the benchmark is not the mean, but the last record).
* When the depth of the graph increases, HydroNets is able to leverage information from deeper branches.
* HydroNets outperforms the baseline in all basins, but upstream basins are harder to predict.
* When reducing the amount of training data, the loss of performance in HydroNets is significantly lower than the baseline.

This study provides an updated water balance model for Aswan High Dam Reservoir, which was validated using combined heterogeneous sources of information, including in situ gauge data, bias-corrected reanalyzed data, and remote sensing information. To investigate the future challenges, the spatial distribution of the annual/seasonal Aswan High Dam Reservoir surface air temperature trends over the period from 1979 to 2018 was studied. An increase of around 0.48◦C per decade in average annual temperature was detected, a trend that is expected to continue until 2100. Moreover, a set of machine learning models were developed and utilized to bias-correct the reanalyzed inflow and outflow data available for Aswan High Dam Reservoir. Finally, a policy tree optimization model was developed to inform the decision-making process and operation of the reservoir system. Results from the historical test simulations show that including reliable inflow data, accurate estimation of evaporation losses, and including new regulations and added projects, such as the Toshka Project, greatly affect the simulation results and guide managers through how the reservoir system should be operated in the future.},

abstract = {Optimization theories explain a variety of forms and functions in plants. At the leaf scale, it is often hypothesized that carbon gain is maximized, thus providing a quantifiable objective for a mathematical definition of optimality conditions. Eco-physiological trade-offs and limited resource availability introduce natural bounds to this optimization process. In particular, carbon uptake from the atmosphere is inherently linked to water losses from the soil as water is taken up by roots and evaporated. Hence, water availability in soils constrains the amount of carbon that can be taken up and assimilated into new biomass. The problem of maximizing photosynthesis at a given water availability by modifying stomatal conductance, the plant-controlled variable to be optimized, has been traditionally formulated for short time intervals over which soil moisture changes can be neglected. This simplification led to a mathematically open solution, where the undefined Lagrange multiplier of the optimization (equivalent to the marginal water use efficiency, ??) is then heuristically determined via data fitting. Here, a set of models based on different assumptions that account for soil moisture dynamics over an individual dry-down are proposed so as to provide closed analytical expressions for the carbon gain maximization problem. These novel solutions link the observed variability in ?? over time, across soil moisture changes, and at different atmospheric CO2 concentrations to water use strategies ranging from intensive, in which all soil water is consumed by the end of the dry-down period, to more conservative, in which water stress is avoided by reducing transpiration. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Since 2005 the European Flood Alert System (EFAS) has been producing probabilistic hydrological forecasts in pre-operational mode at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission. EFAS aims at increasing preparedness for floods in trans-national European river basins by providing medium-range deterministic and proba-bilistic flood forecasting information, from 3 to 10 days in advance, to national hydro-meteorological services. This paper is Part 2 of a study presenting the development and skill assessment of EFAS. In Part 1, the scientific approach adopted in the development of the system has been presented, as well as its basic principles and forecast products. In the present article, two years of existing operational EFAS forecasts are statistically assessed and the skill of EFAS forecasts is analysed with several skill scores. The analysis is based on the comparison of threshold exceedances between proxy-observed and forecasted discharges. Skill is assessed both with and without taking into account the persistence of the forecasted signal during consecutive forecasts. Skill assessment approaches are mostly adopted from meteorology and the analysis also compares probabilistic and deterministic aspects of EFAS. Furthermore, the utility of different skill scores is discussed and their strengths and shortcomings illustrated. The analysis shows the benefit of incorporating past forecasts in the probability analysis, for medium-range forecasts, which effectively increases the skill of the forecasts.},
annote = {Objective

To assess statistically the skill of EFAS forecast during two years of data.

Data

25 months of forecasts: January 2005 – February 2007.
Comparison against a proxy of observed data: the simulated discharge using observed discharge.

Deterministic forecasts:
* DWD: 7 days
* ECMWF: 10 days

Probabilistic forecasts:
* ECMWF: 51 members {\&} 10 days.

Points with less than 4000 km² catchment area are excluded.
It analyzes lead times from 1 to 10 days.

Methodology

Threshold exceedance:
Forecasted discharge is reduced to binary events (flood or not) according to a exceedance threshold. These thresholds were derived from a long run of LISFLOOD with observed meteorology. There used to exist two thresholds: sever alert level (SAL) and high alert level (HAL). Given the low number of events, the study focuses only on exceedances of the HAL threshold.

Persistence:
They study the effects of persistence in forecast skill. They define persistence as:
* 2 consecutive forecast predict flood in the grid cell.
* In ensembles, more than a number of members above the threshold.

Skill score:
Characteristics that a skill score should fulfill:
* Equally representative regardless of the region or climate.
* As little as possible influenced by forecast bias (equitable).

Contingency tables were calculated for each river pixel with an upstream catchment larger than 4000 km². Out of these tables diverse metrics can be computed; the study uses a variety of skill scores:

* Odds ratio 
Odds = TP {\textperiodcentered} TN / (FP * FN)
It takes large values impeding comparison among different studies.

* Hanssen-Kuipers skill score: 
HK = TP / (TP + FN) - FP / (FP + TN) = POD – POFD -For extreme events such as floods, HK = POD = recall

* Frequency bias: ratio between predicted floods and actual floods 
FB = (TP + FP) / (TP + FN)

* Brier skill score: 
BSS = 1 – BSf / BSclim 
BS = 1/n $\Sigma$ (p – o)²

* Probability of detection (recall): 
POD = TP / (TP + FN)

* Frequency of hits (precision): 
FOH = TP / (TP + FP)

* Frequency of misses: 
FOM = FN / (TP + FN) = 1 – POD = 1 – recall

* Reliability diagram: it compares the forecast probability against the observed frequencies, so it identifies easily over or underprediction.
Results

Positive effect of persistence:

*Applying persistence reduces false alerts up to 70{\%}, whereas hits and misses are less affected. These changes disappear for persistence larger than 15 ensemble members.

* Increasing the total probability threshold reduces drastically false alerts, and slightly reduces hits and increases misses.

* Precision and recall are better for the probabilistic approach than for the deterministic, as long as the no. Members threshold is lower than 35.

* The frequency bias shows a general tendency to over-forecast. Values are lower (better) for the probabilistic approach and when the persistence criterion is included.

* The Hanssen-Kuipers score becomes recall in an unbalance case such as floods. The skill decreases steadily with lead time, with higher scores for the probabilistic approach and when persistence is NOT considered. From 30 members on, the scores are similar to the deterministic forecasts.

Reliability diagram:

For most of the no. members threshold, EFAS overpredicts. Some underprediction is observed when the no. ensembles threshold is also applied to the previous forecast.

Discussion

* DWD deterministic forecast renders lower skill than ECMWF deterministic.

* The equiprobability of meteorological ensemble members is not linearly translated into EFAS.

* In EFAS, the probability of a forecast is heavily conditioned on the previous forecast. Therefore, the interest in including persistence.

* The authors state the idea of treating deterministic forecasts as part of the ensemble probabilistic forecasting system by assigning them a weight to calculate a total probability.},

There is increasing electronic access to vast sets of occurrence records in museums and herbaria, yet little effective guidance on how best to use this information in the context of numerous approaches for modelling distributions. To meet this need, we compared 16 modelling methods over 226 species from 6 regions of the world, creating the most comprehensive set of model comparisons to date. We used presence-only data to fit models, and independent presence-absence data to evaluate the predictions. Along with well-established modelling methods such as generalised additive models and GARP and BIOCLIM, we explored methods that either have been developed recently or have rarely been applied to modelling species' distributions. These include machine-learning methods and community models, both of which have features that may make them particularly well suited to noisy or sparse information, as is typical of species' occurrence data. Presence-only data were effective for modelling species' distributions for many species and regions. The novel methods consistently outperformed more established methods. The results of our analysis are promising for the use of data from museums and herbaria, especially as methods suited to the noise inherent in such data improve.},

We used satellite-based and literature-based methods to derive kc values for a distributed hydrologic model. We evaluated the impact of different kc parametrization methods on the water balance and simulated hydrologic response at the basin and sub-basin scale. The hydrological model SPHY was calibrated and validated for a period of 15 years for the upper Segura basin ({\~{}}2500 km2) in Spain, which is characterized by a wide range of terrain, soil, and ecosystem conditions. The model was then applied, using six kc parameterization methods, to determine their spatial and temporal impacts on actual evapotranspiration, streamflow, and soil moisture. The parameterization methods used include: (i) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) observations from MODIS; (ii) seasonally-averaged NDVI patterns, cell-based and landuse-based; and (iii) literature-based tabular values per land use type. The analysis shows that the influence of different kc parametrization methods on basin-level streamflow is relatively small and constant throughout the year, but it has a bigger effect on seasonal evapotranspiration and soil moisture. In the autumn especially, deviations can go up to about 15{\%} of monthly streamflow. At smaller, sub-basin scale, deviations from the NDVI-based reference run can be more than 30{\%}. Overall, the study shows that modeling of future hydrological changes can be improved by using remote sensing information for the parameterization of crop coefficients.},

Well-calibrated physical models can effectively propagate observed information to unobserved variables, but traditional calibration methods often result in nonunique solutions. In this paper, we propose a hydrological parameter calibration training framework consisting of a transformer-based parameter learning model (ParaFormer) and a surrogate model based on LSTM. On the one hand, ParaFormer utilizes self-attention mechanisms to learn a global mapping from observed data to the parameters to be calibrated, which captures spatial correlations. On the other hand, the surrogate model takes the calibrated parameters as inputs and simulates the observable variables, such as soil moisture, overcoming the challenges of directly combining complex hydrological models with a deep learning (DL) platform in a hybrid training scheme. Using the variable infiltration capacity model as the reference, we test the performance of ParaFormer on datasets of different resolutions. The results demonstrate that, in predicting soil moisture and transferring calibrated parameters in the task of evapotranspiration prediction, ParaFormer learns more effective and robust parameter mapping patterns compared to traditional and state-of-the-art DL-based parameter calibration methods.},

In this paper, a theoretical framework is developed for filter algorithms that were constructed under the assumption that the outflow from an aquifer is linearly proportional to its storage. It is shown that these one-parameter filters describing an exponential baseflow recession are all special cases of a two-parameter filter whose equation is specified. Its parameters are the recession constant—which can be objectively determined by a recession analysis—and BFImax, the maximum value of the baseflow index that can be modelled by the algorithm. This introduces a subjective element into the baseflow calculation, since BFImax is not measurable. A preliminary analysis based on the results of conventional separation techniques shows that it might be possible to find typical BFImax values for classes of catchments that can be unequivocally distinguished by their hydrological and hydrogeological characteristics.},

In particular, observations suggest correlations between the water potentials at which xylem cavitation impairs water movement and the one at stomatal closure, and between maximum xylem and stomatal conductances, begging the question as to whether such coordina- tion emerges as an optimal water-use strategy under unpredictable rainfall. Here mean transpiration {\textless}E{\textgreater} is used as a proxy for long-term plant fitness and its variations as a function of the water potentials at 50{\%} loss of stem conductivity due to cavitation and at 90{\%} stomatal closure are explored. It is shown that coor- dination between these hydraulic traits is necessary to maximize {\textless}E{\textgreater}, with rainfall patterns altering the optimal range of trait values. In contrast, coordination between ecosystem-level conductances appears not necessary to maximize {\textless}E{\textgreater}. The optimal trait ranges are wider under drier than under mesic conditions, suggesting that in semiarid systems different water use strategies may be equally successful. Comparison with observations across species from a range of ecosystems confirms model predictions, indicating that the coordinated functioning of plant organs might indeed emerge from an optimal response to rainfall variability.},

For the local population, small reservoirs are important water sources which help them cope with droughts. The lack of knowledge of the number of existing reservoirs, their distribution, and their storage volumes hinders efficient water management and reservoir planning.

To extend the application of HIMS, an ecohydrological modeling system named ecohydrological assessment tool (EcoHAT) has been developed. Integrating parameter- man- agement tools, RS (remote sensing) inversion tools, module-design tools and GIS analysis tools, the EcoHAT provides an integrated tool to simulate ecohydrological processes on regional scale, which develops a new method on sustainable use of water. EcoHAT has been applied to several case studies, such as, the Yellow River Basin, the acid deposition area in Guizhou province and the riparian catch- ment of Guanting reservoir in Beijing. Results prove that EcoHAT can efficiently simulate and analysis the ecohydrological processes on regional scale and provide technical support to integrated water resources management on basin scale.},

abstract = {Land use change is characterized by a high diversity of change trajectories depending on the local conditions, regional context and external influ- ences. Policy intervention aims to counteract the negative consequences of these changes and provide incentives for positive developments. Region typol- ogies are a common tool to cluster regions with similar characteristics and possibly similar policy needs. This paper provides a typology of land use change in Europe at a high spatial resolution based on a series of different scenarios of land use change for the period 2000–2030. A series of simulation models ranging from the global to the landscape level are used to translate scenario conditions in terms of demographic, economic and policy change into changes in European land use pattern. A typology developed based on these simulation results identifies the main trajectories of change across Europe: agricultural abandonment, agricultural expansion and urbanization. The results are combined with common typologies of landscape and rurality. The findings indicate that the typologies based on current landscape and ruralities are poor indicators of the land use dynamics simulated for the regions. It is advocated that typologies based on (simulated) future dynamics of land change are more appropriate to identify regions with potentially similar policy needs.},

abstract = {Natural phenomena have always captivated and surprised human beings, both for their exuberance, complexity and beauty, as for their magnitude, frequency and hazard. The hydrological cycle is one of these phenomena. In many cases, it is necessary to know its state variables for decision-making in several areas of human activity, such as water resources planning and protection against river floods. Hydrological modelling has traditionally been the tool used for this purpose. Hence, the reliable estimation of the state variables involved could depend on the selected model conceptual characteristics. This document presents a hydrological conceptual distributed model which is intended as a tool both for continuous simulation and for flood event simulation. A detailed description of the TETIS program operation and the required files to run the simulations is shown in the corresponding ‘User Manual'. This document presents in a general way the distributed model framework that has been developed within the TETIS program, emphasizing in the conceptual structure of each component modules which form a suitable tool for the complete hydrological simulation. A brief description of the current state of hydrological modelling is also provided. The main components of the TETIS model are described in chapter 3. The information, the parameters and the correction factors of the model are presented in chapter 4 and the optimization algorithm used in the automatic calibration is described in chapter 5.},

abstract = {Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) was measured at 30-min resolution over a 19-month period (September 28, 2000-April 23, 2002) from a nonirrigated pasture site in Florida, USA, using eddy correlation methods. The relative magnitude of measured ETa(about 66{\%} of long-term annual precipitation at the study site) indicates the importance of accurate ETaestimates for water resources planning. The time and cost associated with direct measurements of ETaand the rarity of historical measurements of ETamake the use of methods relying on more easily obtainable data desirable. Several such methods (Penman-Monteith (PM), modified Priestley-Taylor (PT), reference evapotranspiration (ET0), and pan evaporation (Ep)) were related to measured ETausing regression methods to estimate PM bulk surface conductance, PT $\alpha$, ET0vegetation coefficient, and Eppan coefficient. The PT method, where the PT $\alpha$ is a function of green-leaf area index (LAI) and solar radiation, provided the best relation with ETa(standard error (SE) for daily ETaof 0.11 mm). The PM method, in which the bulk surface conductance was a function of net radiation and vapor-pressure deficit, was slightly less effective (SE=0.15 mm) than the PT method. Vegetation coefficients for the ET0method (SE=0.29 mm) were found to be a simple function of LAI. Pan coefficients for the Epmethod (SE=0.40 mm) were found to be a function of LAI and Ep. Historical or future meteorological, LAI, and pan evaporation data from the study site could be used, along with the relations developed within this study, to provide estimates of ETain the absence of direct measurements of ETa. Additionally, relations among PM, PT, and ET0methods and ETacan provide estimates of ETain other, environmentally similar, pasture settings for which meteorological and LAI data can be obtained or estimated. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It is aimed at identifying the event time location with good accuracy and reconstructing the correct amount of daily rainfall. In addition, the statistical properties of the time series, i.e. both probability distribution and long-term statistics, are preserved. The completion method is based on a two-step algorithm that uses information from a cluster of neighboring stations. First, wet and dry days are tagged, and subsequently, the full precipitation amount for wet-classified days is estimated by a modified multi-linear regression approach. This method avoids overestimation of the number of wet days and underestimation of intense precipitation events, which are typical side effects of common regression-based approaches.

abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is normally considered as the sum of all water that evaporates from the soil and transpires from plants. However, accurately estimating ET from complex landscapes can be difficult because of its high spatial heterogeneity and diversity of driver factors, which make extrapolation of data from a point to a larger area quite inaccurate. In this paper, we hypothesize that MODIS products can be of use to estimate ET in areas of Caatinga vegetation, the hydrology of which has not been adequately studied. The experiment was conducted in a preserved level area of Caatinga in which meteorological and water flux measures were taken throughout 2012 by eddy covariance. Evapotranspiration estimates from eddy covariance were compared with remotely sensed evapotranspiration estimates from MOD16A2 and SAFER products. Correlations were performed at monthly, 8-day, and daily scales; and produced r2 values of monthly scale = 0.92, 8-day scale = 0.88, and daily scale = 0.85 for the SAFER algorithm. Monthly MOD16A2 data produced a value of r2=0.82, and they may be useful because they are free, downloadable, and easy to use by researchers and governments.},

abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67{\%} to 77{\%}. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

abstract = {A large proportion of nutrients and sediment is mobilised in catchments during storm events. Therefore understanding a catchment's hydrological behaviour during storms and how this acts to mobilise and transport nutrients and sediment to nearby watercourses is extremely important for effective catchment management. The expansion of available in-situ sensors is allowing a wider range of water quality parameters to be monitored and at higher temporal resolution, meaning that the investigation of hydrochemical behaviours during storms is increasingly feasible. Studying the relationship between discharge and water quality parameters in storm events can provide a valuable research tool to infer the likely source areas and flow pathways contributing to nutrient and sediment transport. Therefore, this paper uses 2 years of high temporal resolution (15/30 min) discharge and water quality (nitrate-N, total phosphorus (TP) and turbidity) data to examine hysteretic behaviour during storm events in two contrasting catchments, in the Hampshire Avon catchment, UK. This paper provides one of the first examples of a study which comprehensively examines storm behaviours for up to 76 storm events and three water quality parameters. It also examines the observational uncertainties using a non-parametric approach. A range of metrics was used, such as loop direction, loop area and a hysteresis index (HI) to characterise and quantify the storm behaviour. With two years of high resolution information it was possible to see how transport mechanisms varied between parameters and through time. This study has also clearly shown the different transport regimes operating between a groundwater dominated chalk catchment versus a surface-water dominated clay catchment. This information, set within an uncertainty framework, means that confidence can be derived that the patterns and relationships thus identified are statistically robust. These insights can thus be used to provide information regarding transport processes and biogeochemical processing within river catchments.},

Two scenarios of soil parametrization assess the modeling implications of moving from homogeneous to heterogeneous porosity. The three given models perform well in terms of discharge and accumulated water balance components. However, their ability to predict soil moisture is found to be more diverging. Interpretations are ambiguous and depend on what performance metric and what level of spatial aggregation is chosen. In comparison to the other models, ParFlow-CLM performs more accurate at predicting the temporal dynamics and the heterogeneity aggregated to catchment scale. Nevertheless, at local scale HydroGeoSphere and MIKE SHE provide more detailed soil moisture predictions. Overall, a clear increase in performance can be attested to the scenario that includes heterogeneous porosity. Next to soil parametrization, topography is among the main drivers of soil moisture variability which was found to have an overemphasized feedback in ParFlow-CLM compared to the other models. This study stresses that further efforts toward spatially distributed input data need to emerge alongside a more suitable soil parametrization that can account for the observed heterogeneity and seasonality of soil moisture.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The evapotranspiration/potential evapotranspiration (AET/PET) ratio is traditionally termed as crop coefficient ({\textless}i{\textgreater}Kc{\textless}/i{\textgreater}) and has been gradually used as ecosystem evaporative stress index. In the current hydrology literature, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kc{\textless}/i{\textgreater} has been widely used to as a parameter to estimate crop water demand by water managers, but has not been well examined for other type of ecosystems such as forests and other perennial vegetation. Understanding the seasonal dynamics of this variable for all ecosystems is important to project the ecohydrologcial responses to climate change and accurately quantify water use (AET) at watershed to global scales. This study aimed at deriving {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kc{\textless}/i{\textgreater} for multiple vegetation cover types and understanding its environmental controls by analyzing the accumulated global eddy flux (FLUXNET) data. We examined monthly AET/PET data for 7 vegetation covers including Open shrubland (OS), Cropland (CRO), Grassland (GRA), Deciduous broad leaf forest (DB), Evergreen needle leaf forest (ENF) and Evergreen broad leaf forest (EBF), and Mixed forest (MF) across 81 sites. We found that, except for evergreen forests (EBF and ENF), {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kc{\textless}/i{\textgreater} values had large seasonal variation across all land covers. The spatial variability of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kc{\textless}/i{\textgreater} was best explained by latitude suggesting site factors has a major control on {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kc{\textless}/i{\textgreater}. Seasonally, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kc{\textless}/i{\textgreater} increased significantly with precipitation in the summer months. Moreover, Leaf Area Index (LAI) significantly influenced monthly {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kc{\textless}/i{\textgreater} in all land covers except EBF. During the peak growing season, forests had the highest Kc values while Croplands (CRO) had the lowest. We developed a series of multi-variatelinear monthly regression models for a large spatial scale {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kc{\textless}/i{\textgreater} by land cover type and season using LAI, site latitude and monthly precipitation as independent variables. The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kc{\textless}/i{\textgreater} models are useful for understanding water stress in different ecosystems under climate change and variability and for estimating seasonal ET for large areas with mixed land covers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The objective of this study is to test whether hydrologic variables can explain land use change. We employ a set of spatially distributed hydrologic variables and compare it against a set of commonly used explanatory variables for land use change. The explanatory power of these variables is assessed by using a logistic regression approach to model the spatial distribution of land use changes in a meso-scale Indian catchment. When hydrologic variables are additionally included, the accuracies of the logistic regression models improve, which is indicated by a change in the relative operating characteristic statistic (ROC) by up to 11{\%}. This is mostly due to the complementarity of the two datasets that is reflected in the use of 44{\%} commonly used variables and 56{\%} hydrologic variables in the best models for land use change.},

abstract = {Hydropower is an important renewable energy source, but it can consume a lot of water due to evaporation from the reservoir surface, which may contribute to water scarcity. Previous studies mostly used a gross evaporation approach for water footprint assessment where all the evaporation is attributed to hydropower. They fail to consider both evapotranspiration before the dam construction, which should be deducted from the footprint, and the seasonal storage dynamics of water. These considerations are critical for assessing reservoir impacts on water scarcity using temporally explicit water stress indices. This study seeks to fill this gap: we calculate the water footprints of ∼1500 hydropower plants which cover 43{\%} of the global annual hydroelectricity generation. Apart from reduced water availability, alterations of the flow regime can also adversely affect ecosystems. Therefore, environmental flow requirements are also analysed. This novel approach for the water footprint assessment of hydropower indicates that previous studies mostly overrated the impacts of hydropower on water scarcity, often because reservoirs store water in periods of low scarcity and release water during months of high water scarcity. By contrast, flow alterations generally affect the environment more than water consumption. Since impacts vary broadly among plants, plant-specific evaluations are necessary.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to evaluate the relative potential of spatially distributed surface and root zone soil moisture estimates in calibration of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) toward improving its hydrologic predictability with reduced equifinality. The Upper Wabash and Cedar Creek, two agriculture-dominated watersheds in Indiana, USA are considered as test beds to implement this multi-objective SWAT calibration. The proposed calibration approach is performed using remotely sensed Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System surface soil moisture ({\~{}}1 cm top soil) estimates (NASA's Aqua daily level-3 gridded land surface product-version 2) in sub-basin/HRU level together with observed streamflow data at the watershed's outlet. Although application of remote sensing data in calibration improves surface soil moisture simulation, other hydrologic components such as streamflow, evapotranspiration (ET) and deeper layer moisture content in SWAT remain less affected. An extension of this approach to apply root zone soil moisture estimates from limited field sensor data showed considerable improvement in the simulation of root zone moisture content and streamflow with corresponding observed data. Difference in relative sensitivity of parameters and reduced extent of uncertainty are also evident from the proposed method, especially for parameters related to the subsurface hydrologic processes. Regardless, precise representation of vertical soil moisture stratification at different layers is difficult with current SWAT ET depletion mechanism. While the results from this study show that root zone soil moisture can play a major role in SWAT calibration, more studies including various soil moisture data products are necessary to validate the proposed approach.},

The Kling-Gupta efficiency (R KG ), which has been introduced as an improvement of the widely used Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, considers different types of model errors, namely the error in the mean, the variability, and the dynamics. The calculation of R KG is implicitly based on the assumptions of data linearity, data normality, and the absence of outliers. In this study, we propose a modification of R KG as an efficiency measure comprising non-parametric components, i.e. the Spearman rank correlation and the normalized flow–duration curve. The performances of model simulations for 100 catchments using the new measure were compared to those obtained using R KG based on a number of statistical metrics and hydrological signatures. The new measure resulted overall in better or comparable model performances, and thus it was concluded that efficiency measures with non-parametric components provide a suitable alternative to commonly used measures.},

The satellite Snow Cover Area products are known to be of good quality and are regularly used for studies in the meteorological and hydrological fields. However, these products are reprocessed and thus are not representative of the quality of a real-time product that would be needed for operational applications. The assessment of a real-time Snow Cover Area daily product at 250. m-resolution (the EURAC MODIS SCA product, which is based on the MODIS sensor) by comparing it directly or indirectly to the classical NASA MODIS SCA daily product and to the simulated Snow Cover Area of the distributed hydrological model, LISFLOOD, is realized in this article at the pan-European scale. This real-time product showed an overall good performance compared with the classical product, and a good agreement with the LISFLOOD simulated snow over Europe. The study showed the impact of forest cover on the scores of the compared products, whereas altitude did not have an impact. Using quality flags that are provided with the EURAC product improved its performance by reducing the misclassification of clouds as snow. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Numerical weather forecasts, such as meteorological forecasts of precipitation, are inherently uncertain. These uncertainties depend on model physics as well as initial and boundary conditions. Since precipitation forecasts form the input into hydrological models, the uncertainties of the precipitation forecasts result in uncertainties of flood forecasts. In order to consider these uncertainties, ensemble prediction systems are applied. These systems consist of several members simulated by different models or using a single model under varying initial and boundary conditions. However, a too wide uncertainty range obtained as a result of taking into account members with poor prediction skills may lead to underestimation or exaggeration of the risk of hazardous events. Therefore, the uncertainty range of model-based flood forecasts derived from the meteorological ensembles has to be restricted. In this paper, a methodology towards improving flood forecasts by weighting ensemble members according to their skills is presented. The skill of each ensemble member is evaluated by comparing the results of forecasts corresponding to this member with observed values in the past. Since numerous forecasts are required in order to reliably evaluate the skill, the evaluation procedure is time-consuming and tedious. Moreover, the evaluation is highly subjective, because an expert who performs it makes his decision based on his implicit knowledge. Therefore, approaches for the automated evaluation of such forecasts are required. Here, we present a semi-automated approach for the assessment of precipitation forecast ensemble members. The approach is based on supervised machine learning and was tested on ensemble precipitation forecasts for the area of the Mulde river basin in Germany. Based on the evaluation results of the specific ensemble members, weights corresponding to their forecast skill were calculated. These weights were then successfully used to reduce the uncertainties within rainfall-runoff simulations and flood risk predictions.},

The results show that the use of a mixture model provides a more accurate description of the observed data than the Gumbel distribution, but is comparable to the GEV model.

abstract = {Arid to semi-arid regions are characterized by low levels of surface$\backslash$nwater and low annual precipitation (generally {\textless} 350 mm/year). In such$\backslash$nareas, groundwater must be used to meet all the needs of the population$\backslash$nfor water. As a consequence, careful management is required to ensure$\backslash$nthe sustainability of this scarce resource in response to the demands of$\backslash$nurban centers, industry, agriculture, and tourism. The concept of the$\backslash$naquifer recharge rate is particularly useful in the quantification of$\backslash$nthese groundwater resources and can be used to form the basis of a$\backslash$ndecision support system. This study determined the potential recharge$\backslash$nrate in the Haouz aquifer using a multi-criteria analysis that included$\backslash$nboth the major and minor factors influencing the rate of infiltration of$\backslash$nwater into the aquifer. The analysis was based on the use of a$\backslash$ngeographical information system supported by remote sensing techniques$\backslash$nto develop thematic data layers. These layers were then used to describe$\backslash$nthe spatial variation of the factors influencing the recharge rate of$\backslash$nthe aquifer and were subsequently integrated and analyzed to derive the$\backslash$nspatial distribution of the potential recharge. This approach was used$\backslash$nto classify the Haouz Plain (Morocco) into three different zones with$\backslash$nrespect to the recharge rate, with recharge rates ranging from 3.5 to$\backslash$n18.2 {\%}.},

abstract = {The Atlantic mountains of Spain are suffering a strong landscape change due to a widespread and intensive emigration to urban areas since the 1950s. This process, representative of global developments in an imminent future, is dominated by urban societies and leads to deep landscape changes in which crop fields and grasslands are abandoned and progressively covered by forest and shrubs. These dynamics have caused in turn a decrease in the runoff and a general slowdown of geomorphological processes. The impacts of land cover change have been simultaneous to an irregularity in precipitation and a significant increase of temperatures. With this background, this paper assesses in detail the impact of landscape change occurred over the last decades (twentieth and twenty-first centuries) on the water and sediment yield in the Pisuerga catchment headwaters (Cantabrian Mountains, N Spain). We analyzed the different components of Global Change in a catchment of 233 km2 extent, that has passed from 15 to 2 habitants/km2, from multiple data sources. Evolution of land cover was reconstructed from aerial photographs, remote sensing and other resources. The climatic parameters have been studied through meteorological stations, and the hydrological and sedimentological responses over time are based on available runoff data and sedimentological analysis. Our results show a significant decrease in water and sediment transport mainly driven by vegetation increase occurred in a non-linear way, more intense immediately after abandonment. This fact opens the opportunity to control more accurately water resources in Mediterranean catchments through land use management.},

abstract = {The influence of soil moisture dynamics on soil carbon and nitrogen cycles is analyzed by coupling an existing stochastic soil moisture model [Adv. Water Resour. 24 (7) (2001) 707; Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 455 (1999) 3789] to a system of eight nonlinear differential equations that describe the temporal evolution of the organic matter and the mineral nitrogen in the soil at the daily to seasonal time scales. Special attention is devoted to the modeling of the soil moisture control on mineralization and immobilization fuxes, leaching losses, and plant nitrogen uptake, as well as to the role played by the soil organic matter carbon-to-nitrogen ratio in determining mineralization and immobilization. The model allows a detailed analysis of the soil nitrogen cycle as driven by fluctuations in soil moisture at the daily time scale resulting from the stochastic rainfall variability. The complex ensuing dynamics are studied in detail in a companion paper [Adv. Water Resour. 26 (1) (2003) 59], which presents an application to the Nylsvley savanna in South Africa. The model accounts for the soil moisture control on different components of the nitrogen cycle on a wide range of time scales: From the high frequency variability of leaching and uptake due to the nitrate flushes after persistent rainfall following a period of drought, to the low frequency temporal dynamics of the soil organic matter pools. All the .uctuations in the various pools are statistically characterized in relation to their dependence on climate, soil, and vegetation characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Accurate simulation of reservoirs has been a challenge for global hydrological models due to highly discontinuous water management and uncertainties in reservoir shape representation. In addition, at a global scale, it is crucial to consider those reservoirs that disrupt the downstream flow regime. We augment the mesoscale Hydrological Model with a newly developed lake module (LM) that incorporates an existing reservoir regulation scheme with non‐consumptive demand predictions from random forest. We also evaluate the sensitivity of reservoir shape on streamflow and evaporation for three shape approximations of varying complexities. We tested the LM across 31 non‐consumptive reservoirs covering an extensive range of hydroclimatic characteristics and demonstrate the applicability by using freely available global reservoir information. Streamflow simulations with reservoirs and model calibration show a median Kling‐Gupta Efficiency improvement of +0.94 (calibration) and +0.77 (validation) when compared against model simulations without reservoirs and default parameter set. We find reservoir evaporation highly sensitive to reservoir shape with half‐pyramid approximation consistently resulting in best fit at reservoirs with surveyed bathymetry. In contrast, the linear approximation (rectangular prism) produced a median bias of +114{\%} relative to half‐pyramid, for estimating evaporation, across all the reservoirs. Streamflow simulations were insensitive to the reservoir shape. Our analysis shows that 30{\%} of the non‐consumptive hydropower reservoirs of the GRanD data set are non‐disruptive and can be excluded without loss to model realism. Further work is necessary for testing the regulation approach in reservoirs with consumptive water usage.},

abstract = {Distributed hydrological models simulate states and fluxes of water and energy in the terrestrial hydrosphere at each cell. The predicted spatial patterns result from complex nonlinear relationships and feedbacks. Spatial patterns are often neglected during the modeling process, and therefore a spatial sensitivity analysis framework that highlights their importance is proposed. This study features a comprehensive analysis of spatial patterns of actual evapotranspiration (ET) and land surface temperature (LST), with the aim of quantifying the extent to which forcing data and model parameters drive these patterns. This framework is applied on a distributed model [MIKE Syst{\`{e}}me Hydrologique Europ{\'{e}}en (MIKE SHE)] coupled to a land surface model [Shuttleworth and Wallace-Evapotranspiration (SW-ET)] of a catchment in Denmark. Twenty-two scenarios are defined, each having a simplified representation of a potential driver of spatial variability. A baseline model that incorporates full spatial detail is used to assess sensitivity. High sensitivity can be attested in scenarios where the simulated spatial patterns differ significantly from the baseline. The core novelty of this study is that the analysis is based on a set of innovative spatial performance metrics that enable a reliable spatial pattern comparison. Overall, LST is very sensitive to air temperature and wind speed whereas ET is rather driven by vegetation. Both are sensitive to groundwater coupling and precipitation. The conclusions may be limited to the selected catchment and to the applied modeling system, but the suggested framework is generically relevant for the modeling community. While the applied metrics focus on specific spatial information, they partly exhibit redundant information. Thus, a combination of metrics is the ideal approach to evaluate spatial patterns in models output.},

abstract = {Multi-model ensembles are one of the most common ways to deal with epistemic uncertainty in hydrology. This is a problem because there is no known way to sample models such that the resulting ensemble admits a measure that has any systematic (i.e., asymptotic, bounded, or consistent) relationship with uncertainty. Multi-model ensembles are effectively sensitivity analyses and cannot – even partially – quantify uncertainty. One consequence of this is that multi-model approaches cannot support a consistent scientific method – in particular, multi-model approaches yield unbounded errors in inference. In contrast, information theory supports a coherent hypothesis test that is robust to (i.e., bounded under) arbitrary epistemic uncertainty. This paper may be understood as advocating a procedure for hypothesis testing that does not require quantifying uncertainty, but is coherent and reliable (i.e., bounded) in the presence of arbitrary (unknown and unknowable) uncertainty. We conclude by offering some suggestions about how this proposed philosophy of science suggests new ways to conceptualize and construct simulation models of complex, dynamical systems.},

abstract = {Root system architecture (RSA) can significantly affect plant access to water, total transpiration, as well as its partitioning by soil depth, with implications for surface heat, water, and carbon budgets. Despite recent ad- vances in land surface model (LSM) descriptions of plant hydraulics, descriptions of RSA have not been included because of their three-dimensional complexity, which makes them generally too computationally costly. Here we demonstrate a new, process-based 1D layered model that captures the dynamic shifts in water potential gradients of 3D RSA under different soil moisture conditions: the RSA stencil. Using root systems calibrated to the rooting profiles of four plant functional types (PFT) of the Community Land Model, we show that the RSA stencil predicts plant water potentials within 2{\%} to the outputs of a full 3D model, under the same assumptions on soil moisture heterogeneity, despite its trivial computational cost, resulting in improved predictions of water uptake and soil moisture compared to a model without RSA in a transient simulation. Our results suggest that LSM predictions of soil moisture dynamics and dependent variables can be improved by the implementation of this model, cali- brated for individual PFTs using field observations.},

abstract = {This paper presents the development of the Eu-ropean Flood Alert System (EFAS), which aims at increasing preparedness for floods in trans-national European river basins by providing local water authorities with medium-range and probabilistic flood forecasting information 3 to 10 days in advance. The EFAS research project started in 2003 with the development of a prototype at the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC), in close collaboration with the national hydrological and meteorological services. The prototype covers the whole of Europe on a 5 km grid. In parallel, different high-resolution data sets have been collected for the Elbe and Danube river basins, allowing the potential of the system under optimum conditions and on a higher resolution to be assessed. Flood warning lead-times of 3-10 days are achieved through the incorporation of medium-range weather forecasts from the Ger-man Weather Service (DWD) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), comprising a full set of 51 probabilistic forecasts from the Ensemble Prediction System (EPS) provided by ECMWF. The ensemble of different hydrographs is analysed and combined to produce early flood warning information, which is disseminated to the hydrological services that have agreed to participate in the development of the system. In Part 1 of this paper, the scientific approach adopted in the development of the system is presented. The rational of the project, the systems setup , its underlying components, basic principles and products are described. In Part 2, results of a detailed statistical analysis of the performance of the system are shown, with regard to both probabilistic and deterministic forecasts.},

abstract = {A promising approach to catchment classification makes use of unsupervised neural networks (Self Organising Maps, SOM's), which organise input data through non-linear techniques depending on the intrinsic similarity of the data themselves. Our study considers ∼300 Italian catchments scattered nationwide, for which several descriptors of the streamflow regime and geomorphoclimatic characteristics are available. We compare a reference classification, identified by using indices of the streamflow regime as input to SOM, with four alternative classifications, which were identified on the basis of catchment descriptors that can be derived for ungauged basins. One alternative classification adopts the available catchment descriptors as input to SOM, the remaining classifications are identified by applying SOM to sets of derived variables obtained by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to the available catchment descriptors. The comparison is performed relative to a PUB problem, that is for predicting several streamflow indices in ungauged basins. We perform an extensive cross-validation to quantify nationwide the accuracy of predictions of mean annual runoff, mean annual flood, and flood quantiles associated with given exceedance probabilities. Results of the study indicate that performing PCA and, in particular, CCA on the available set of catchment descriptors before applying SOM significantly improves the effectiveness of SOM classifications by reducing the uncertainty of hydrological predictions in ungauged sites. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2011.},

abstract = {Erosion processes at the catchment scale control a basin's morphology
and sediment patterns in the river network. Eroded sediments are
transported and deposited downstream and may cause environmental
problems and relevant effects on water storage and hydropower
infrastructures. Quantification of water and sediment yield is complex
due to the physical processes involved and their temporal and spatial
variability, especially at the light of current global change.
Numerical models that use spatially distributed information constitute a
useful tool for these estimates, when sufficient input data are
available. In this study, we applied the hydrological and
sedimentological TETIS model to determine the patterns of water and
sediment yield in a large mountain catchment. Flow discharge data
obtained from two gauged stations were used for calibration and
validation of the hydrological sub-model. Data from two reservoir
bathymetries at the outlet of the study area were used for calibration
of the sedimentological sub-model. After model calibration, several
scenarios of climate and land use change were simulated.
Climate scenarios show a general decrease in average annual
precipitation and an increase in temperature, associated with an
increase in extreme rainfall events. Global change scenarios lead to a
counteracting effect between the increase in sediment transport during
extreme events and the decrease in sediment erosion associated with
afforestation following the abandonment of agricultural land. In the
case of the most extreme climate scenario combined with total catchment
deforestation, the model indicates a complete siltation of the reservoir
by 2050.
Model performance emphasizes its potential as a tool for evaluating
water and sediment yield for large catchments, as well as of its
usefulness for water and sediment management in light of future climate
and land use change scenarios.},

abstract = {Accurate identification of the origin of groundwater samples is not always possible in complex multilayered aquifers. This poses a major difficulty for a reliable interpretation of geochemical results. The problem is especially severe when the information on the tubewells design is hard to obtain. This paper shows a supervised classification method based on the Random Forest (RF) machine learning technique to identify the layer from where groundwater samples were extracted. The classification rules were based on the major ion composition of the samples. We applied this method to the Campo de Cartagena multi-layer aquifer system, in southeastern Spain. A large amount of hydrogeochemical data was available, but only a limited fraction of the sampled tubewells included a reliable determination of the borehole design and, consequently, of the aquifer layer being exploited. Added difficulty was the very similar compositions of water samples extracted from different aquifer layers. Moreover, not all groundwater samples included the same geochemical variables. Despite of the difficulty of such a background, the Random Forest classification reached accuracies over 90{\%}. These results were much better than the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Decision Trees (CART) supervised classification methods. From a total of 1549 samples, 805 proceeded from one unique identified aquifer, 409 proceeded from a possible blend of waters from several aquifers and 335 were of unknown origin. Only 468 of the 805 unique-aquifer samples included all the chemical variables needed to calibrate and validate the models. Finally, 107 of the groundwater samples of unknown origin could be classified. Most unclassified samples did not feature a complete dataset. The uncertainty on the identification of training samples was taken in account to enhance the model. Most of the samples that could not be identified had an incomplete dataset. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A system has been developed to give probabilistic warnings of severe-weather events for the United Kingdom (UK) on a regional and national basis, based on forecast output from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Ensemble Prediction System (EPS). The First-Guess Early Warnings (FGEW) project aims to give guidance to operational forecasters, to help them give earlier warning of severe weather in support of the UK National Severe Weather Warning Service (NSWWS). Calibration was applied to the EPS model output to optimize the probabilistic early warnings over an initial training period of one winter season, and the resulting warnings were then verified over a 16-month period spanning two winter seasons. The skill of warnings from several versions of FGEW is assessed using a range of probabilistic skill scores, and is also compared with that of warnings issued by forecasters. Results show that the system is capable of providing useful warnings 3-4 days ahead with some probabilistic skill. Most of the skill is attributable to warnings issued at low probabilities, but when higher probabilities do occur, this provides a valuable signal that has been used by forecasters on a number of occasions to issue warnings earlier than was done previously. Maximum skill of the FGEW warnings is found at a lead time of 4 days, with virtually no skill at shorter lead times of 1 or 2 days. This behavior is found to also occur in equivalent deterministic forecasts and so is not attributable to the ensemble perturbation strategy. Nevertheless it is suggested that while the EPS perturbations work well for the medium range, alternative perturbation strategies may be required for successful short-range ensemble prediction.},

Parameter estimation is hence a very common problem in environmental sciences and has received tremendous amount of research and industry attention. This chapter reviews some of the key principles of parameter estimation, with a focus on calibration approaches and uncertainty quantification. The distinct approaches of manual calibration, optimization, multi-objective optimization, and probabilistic approaches are described in terms of key theory and representative applications. Advantages and limitations of these strategies are listed and discussed, with a focus on their ability to represent parametric and predictive uncertainties. The role of posterior diagnostics to check calibration and model assumptions that impact on parameter estimation is emphasized. Auxiliary tricks and techniques are described to simplify the process of parameter estimation in practical applications. The chapter concludes with an outline of directions for ongoing and future research. It is hoped that this chapter will help hydrologists and environmental modellers get to the current state of research and practice in model calibration, parameter estimation, and uncertainty quantification.},

abstract = {Infilling missing data might be an unpleasant and tedious task, but is necessary for analysis and water resources management, so it should not be done in a lackadaisical manner. The important thing about the infilled values is that they need to be as good as possible, because poor infilling is likely to lead to poor decisions. Traditionally, a range of methods is routinely employed, e.g. Nearest Neighbor substitution through to Kriging, but few methods attach a quality estimate to the infilled values. In this paper a new copula based method is developed for infilling missing daily and monthly rain gauge data and is compared against six other commonly used methods, in a semi-arid environment with a range of rain-rates and interstation distances, in the Southern Cape region of South Africa. For daily data it is clear that the copula-based methods are superior to the others in terms of point estimation and have the added benefit of providing an estimate of the precision of the interpolation, not provided by the others. In our case, the addition of atmospheric circulation patterns designed to add information for infilling has a relatively small positive effect on the quality of the estimation. The main reason for this is that a small number of wet days does not allow a good estimation of the conditional distribution of precipitation amounts; we note that the average probability of a dry day in this region is 86{\%}. An improvement of the estimate of the probability of a dry day was however observed. In other regions, with a higher number of wet days, an atmospheric Circulation Pattern (CP) based method is likely to lead to further improvements. Using copula-based methods, the estimated probabilities of a dry day correspond well to the observed frequencies of dry days. The monthly data yield the same conclusion, with the qualification that the Expectation Maximisation [EM] algorithm performs as well as the copula method (because of the low count of dry months in this region) but its relative disadvantage is that it does not offer as valuable a precision estimate.},

abstract = {Dynamic models of root system development and architecture integrate various developmental processes and let simulate multiple dynamic interactions. They are recognised as valuable tools to study the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum. In the recent years, some models have emerged from fractal descriptions. Others arose from devel-opmental approaches but most efforts met little success for genericity. Among the difficulties with models are their growing complexity and they inability to detail evenly all important mechanisms often due to a deficit of independent and suitable data for model testing. We propose here a generic model called 'Root Typ' dedicated to quantitative and global analyses of root system architectures and simplified representation of architectural diversity. It aims at (i) detailing evenly a large range of developmental processes, (ii) generalising the concept of root type and (iii) representing in a very simplified way soil effects on developmental processes. The model implements several developmental processes including: root emission, axial and radial growth, sequential branching, reitera-tion, transition, decay and abscission, which are all discussed in details. Finally, it's ability to mimic a diversity of root architectures is tested against representative root systems depicted in the book of Kutschera (1960) which represents an independent database collected on a large number of plant species and soil conditions, and gives an overall synthetic view upon root systems.},

abstract = {The development of automated (computer-based) calibration methods has focused mainly on the selection of a single-objective measure of the distance between the model-simulated output and the data and the selection of an automatic optimization algorithm to search for the parameter values which minimize that distance. However, practical experience with model calibration suggests that no single-objective function is adequate to measure the ways in which the model fails to match the important characteristics of the observed data. Given that some of the latest hydrologic models simulate several of the watershed output fluxes (e.g. water, energy, chemical constituents, etc.), there is a need for effective and efficient multi-objective calibration procedures capable of exploiting all of the useful information about the physical system contained in the measurement data time series. The MOCOM-UA algorithm, an effective and efficient methodology for solving the multiple-objective global optimization problem, is presented in this paper. The method is an extension of the successful SCE-UA single-objective global optimization algorithm. The features and capabilities of MOCOM-UA are illustrated by means of a simple hydrologic model calibration study.},

Se presenta el algoritmo MOCOM-UA (multiobjective complex evolution -Univesity of Arizona), una metodolog{\'{i}}a eficiente y eficaz para la optimizaci{\'{o}}n global multiobjetivo de modelos hidrol{\'{o}}gicos. Su capacidad es probada a trav{\'{e}}s de un caso de estudio.

Teor{\'{i}}as e hip{\'{o}}tesis:
El algoritmo MOCOM-UA tiene como objetivo encontrar el conjunto de Pareto de un modelo a partir de la optimizaci{\'{o}}n conjunta de una funci{\'{o}}n multiobjetivo (F) con n funciones objetivo.

El algoritmo s{\'{o}}lo necesita un dato de entrada, el n{\'{u}}mero de puntos de la poblaci{\'{o}}n (s).

El algoritmo se organiza en los siguientes pasos:
0. Inicializaci{\'{o}}n. Selecci{\'{o}}n de los s puntos dentro del espacio de par{\'{a}}metros y el c{\'{a}}lculo de F iniciales.
1. Ranking de Pareto de los puntos creando subconjuntos de Pareto dentro de los puntos dominados.
2. Selecci{\'{o}}n. La selecci{\'{o}}n se hace en funci{\'{o}}n del ranking de manera que se favorezcan los puntos m{\'{a}}s pr{\'{o}}ximos al conjunto de Pareto.
3. Evoluci{\'{o}}n del complejo multiobjetivo. Se crean simplejos de n+1 puntos, inlcuyendo uno de los peores puntos y una selecci{\'{o}}n aleatoria de los restantes n puntos seg{\'{u}}n el punto 2.
4. Evoluci{\'{o}}n de simplejos multiobjetivo cuesta abajo (MOSIM). El peor punto de cada simplejo es mejorado a partir del centroide de los otros n puntos. Dos opciones: reflexi{\'{o}}n y contracci{\'{o}}n (si la reflexi{\'{o}}n no mejora el punto).
5. Iteraci{\'{o}}n. Los pasos 2-4 se repiten hasta que todos los puntos pertenezcan al conjunto de Pareto.

Metodolog{\'{i}}a:
Se aplica el algoritmo a modo de ejemplo para la calibraci{\'{o}}n de un a{\~{n}}o h{\'{u}}medo en el modelo hidrol{\'{o}}gico SAC-SMA en la cuencadel Leaf River. Se utiliza una funci{\'{o}}n biobjetivo con el DRMS y el HMLE, y una poblaci{\'{o}}n de 500 puntos.
Se analiza el rango {\'{o}}ptimo de cada uno de los par{\'{a}}metros y se compara el rando de caudales simulados con el obesrvado.
Se estudia la sensibilidad del algoritmo de calibraci{\'{o}}n frente al tama{\~{n}}o de la poblaci{\'{o}}n.

Resultados:
Calibraci{\'{o}}n y simulaci{\'{o}}n:
- Se genera un conjunto uniforme de soluciones.
- Ciertos par{\'{a}}metros, relacionados con caudales bajos, toman valores distintos en funci{\'{o}}n de la funci{\'{o}}n objetivo.
- La simulaci{\'{o}}n de caudales no abarca las observaciones para caudales bajos.

An{\'{a}}lisis de sensibilidad:
- Los resultados mejoran conforme aumenta s.

One important source of uncertainty in models for flow and transport processes in the subsurface is the model concept. While uncertain model parameters or forcing terms can be captured as random processes and random fields, this type of uncertainty cannot be included into a model in a straightforward manner. This is particularly true if established model descriptions of a given process are not known or are still being debated. In this contribution, we outline several examples of subsurface flow and transport modeling where uncertainty of the model concept plays an important role. We discuss the need for the development of methods and standards to deal with this type of uncertainty in model hypothesis testing.},

abstract = {The self-organizing map (SOM) is an automatic data-analysis method. It is widely applied to clustering problems and data exploration in industry, finance, natural sciences, and linguistics. The most extensive applications, exemplified in this paper, can be found in the management of massive textual databases and in bioinformatics. The SOM is related to the classical vector quantization (VQ), which is used extensively in digital signal processing and transmission. Like in VQ, the SOM represents a distribution of input data items using a finite set of models. In the SOM, however, these models are automatically associated with the nodes of a regular (usually two-dimensional) grid in an orderly fashion such that more similar models become automatically associated with nodes that are adjacent in the grid, whereas less similar models are situated farther away from each other in the grid. This organization, a kind of similarity diagram of the models, makes it possible to obtain an insight into the topographic relationships of data, especially of high-dimensional data items. If the data items belong to certain predetermined classes, the models (and the nodes) can be calibrated according to these classes. An unknown input item is then classified according to that node, the model of which is most similar with it in some metric used in the construction of the SOM. A new finding introduced in this paper is that an input item can even more accurately be represented by a linear mixture of a few best-matching models. This becomes possible by a least-squares fitting procedure where the coefficients in the linear mixture of models are constrained to nonnegative values. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This study tests the performance and uncertainty of calibration strategies for a spatially distributed hydrologic model in order to improve model simulation accuracy and understand prediction uncertainty at interior ungaged sites of a sparsely gaged watershed. The study is conducted using a distributed version of the HYMOD hydrologic model (HYMOD-DS) applied to the Kabul River basin. Several calibration experiments are conducted to understand the benefits and costs associated with different calibration choices, including (1) whether multisite gaged data should be used simultaneously or in a stepwise manner during model fitting, (2) the effects of increasing parameter complexity, and (3) the potential to estimate interior watershed flows using only gaged data at the basin outlet. The implications of the different calibration strategies are considered in the context of hydrologic projections under climate change. To address the research questions, high-performance computing is utilized to manage the computational burden that results from high-dimensional optimization problems. Several interesting results emerge from the study. The simultaneous use of multisite data is shown to improve the calibration over a stepwise approach, and both multisite approaches far exceed a calibration based on only the basin outlet. The basin outlet calibration can lead to projections of mid-21st century streamflow that deviate substantially from projections under multisite calibration strategies, supporting the use of caution when using distributed models in data-scarce regions for climate change impact assessments. Surprisingly, increased parameter complexity does not substantially increase the uncertainty in streamflow projections, even though parameter equifinality does emerge. The results suggest that increased (excessive) parameter complexity does not always lead to increased predictive uncertainty if structural uncertainties are present. The largest uncertainty in future streamflow results from variations in projected climate between climate models, which substantially outweighs the calibration uncertainty.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of analysing the coupling of meteorological meso-scale quantitative precipitation forecasts with distributed rainfallrunoff models to extend the forecasting horizon. Traditionally, semi-distributed rainfallrunoff models have been used for real time flood forecasting. More recently, increased computer capabilities allow the utilisation of distributed hydrological models with mesh sizes from tenths of metres to a few kilometres. On the other hand, meteorological models, providing the quantitative precipitation forecast, tend to produce average values on meshes ranging from slightly less than 10 to 200 kilometres. Therefore, to improve the quality of flood forecasts, the effects of coupling the meteorological and the hydrological models at different scales were analysed. A distributed hydrological model (TOPKAPI) was developed and calibrated using a 1×1 km mesh for the case of the river Po closed at Ponte Spessa (catchment area c. 37 000 km 2). The model was then coupled with several other European meteorological models ranging from the Limited Area Models (provided by DMI and DWD) with resolutions from 0.0625°*0.0625°, to the ECMWF ensemble predictions with a resolution of 1.85°*1.85°. Interesting results, describing the coupled model behaviour, are available for a meteorological extreme event in Northern Italy (Nov. 1994). The results demonstrate the poor reliability of the quantitative precipitation forecasts produced by meteorological models presently available; this is not resolved using the Ensemble Forecasting technique, when compared with results obtainable with measured rainfall.},

abstract = {Current land surface models use increasingly complex descriptions of the processes that they represent. Increase in complexity is accompanied by an increase in the number of model parameters, many of which cannot be measured directly at large spatial scales. A Monte Carlo framework was used to evaluate the sensitivity and identifiability of ten parameters controlliiqg surface and subsurface runoff generation in the Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC). Using the Monte Carlo Analysis Toolbox (MCAT), parameter sensitivities were studied for four U.S. watersheds along a hydroclimatic gradient, based on a 20-year data set developed for the Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX). Results showed that simulated streamflows are sensitive to three parameters when evaluated with different objective functions. Sensitivity of the infiltration parameter (b) and the drainage parameter (exp) were strongly related to the hydroclimatic gradient. The placement of vegetation roots played an important role in the sensitivity of model simulations to the thickness of the second soil layer (thick{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}). Overparameterization was found in the base flow formulation indicating that a simplified version could be implemented. Parameter sensitivity was more strongly dictated by climatic gradients than by changes in soil properties. Results showed how a complex model can be reduced to a more parsimonious form, leading to a more identifiable model with an increased chance of successful regionalization to ungauged basins. Although parameter sensitivities are strictly valid for VIC, this model is representative of a wider class of macroscale hydrological models. Consequently, the results and methodology will have applicability to other hydrological models. Copyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Aplicar un balance de carbono a escala ecosist{\'{e}}mica para determinar la funci{\'{o}}n objetivo que controla la organizaci{\'{o}}n de los tipos funcionales de vegetaci{\'{o}}n en una cuenca.

Metodolog{\'{i}}a:
Se deriva la entrop{\'{i}}a del sistema como una funci{\'{o}}n proporcional a la tasa de fotosintetizaci{\'{o}}n del ecosistema. 
$\sigma$ = 1/T {\textperiodcentered} P {\textperiodcentered} µ
Se optimiza esta funci{\'{o}}n utilizando un algoritmo de recocido simulado. Se estudiael resultado para tres valores de la temperatura de recocido: $\theta$=0; $\theta$=4{\textperiodcentered}10-3; $\theta$=1 (aleatorio).
Los resultados de la distribuci{\'{o}}n optimizada de vegetaci{\'{o}}n se comparan con la distribuci{\'{o}}n real de cuatro maneras:
- Mapa de la distribuci{\'{o}}n de vegetaci{\'{o}}n.
- Perfiles de vegetaci{\'{o}}n (funciones de {\'{a}}rea).
- M{\'{a}}ximo de productividad en funci{\'{o}}n del valor de $\theta$.
- Relaci{\'{o}}n alom{\'{e}}trica entre la transpiraci{\'{o}}n total media y la escorrent{\'{i}}a total media.

Teor{\'{i}}as e hip{\'{o}}tesis:
- La adaptaci{\'{o}}n de las plantas al ecosistema sigue una funci{\'{o}}n objetivo.
- La distribuci{\'{o}}n de vegetaci{\'{o}}n evoluciona hacia estados de m{\'{a}}xima producci{\'{o}}n de entrop{\'{i}}a.
- Para sistemas abiertos no en equilibrio y r{\'{e}}gimen estacionario, estados de m{\'{a}}xima producci{\'{o}}n de entrop{\'{i}}a son preferibles puesto que pueden existir en un mayor n{\'{u}}mmero de entornos.

Resultados:
Mapas de distribuci{\'{o}}n: el mapa m{\'{a}}s similar al real se obtiene a partir de $\theta$=4{\textperiodcentered}10-3. La primera simulaci{\'{o}}n no es capaz de representar los pastos y la tercera es aleatoria.

Perfiles de vegetaci{\'{o}}n: las dos primeras simulaciones son capaces de simular apropiadamente los perfiles de los {\'{a}}rboles y arbustos, ligeramente mejor para $\theta$=4{\textperiodcentered}10-3. 
En el caso de los pastos s{\'{o}}lo son reproducidos por la segunda simulaci{\'{o}}n y a{\'{u}}n as{\'{i}} se desv{\'{i}}a del original para valores altos de distancia.

La m{\'{a}}xima productividad se obtiene para $\theta$=0. La segunda simulaci{\'{o}}n est{\'{a}}, sin embargo cerca del m{\'{a}}ximo.

La s{\'{i}}ntesis alom{\'{e}}trica para la segunda optimizaci{\'{o}}n obtiene una pendiente muy similar a la distribuci{\'{o}}n real (dependiente de la red de drenaje) y una ordenada en el origen muy pr{\'{o}}xima (dependiente de la organizaci{\'{o}}n de la vegetaci{\'{o}}n). Otras optimizaciones obtienen pendientes pr{\'{o}}ximas pero ordenadas en el origen desviadas.

Limitaciones:

La implementaci{\'{o}}n del submodelo de sedimentos se ha realizado utilizando como referencia los vol{\'{u}}menes de sedimentos deposi-tados en el embalse medidos a partir de tres batimetr{\'{i}}as hist{\'{o}}ricas. Para analizar los efectos del cambio cli-m{\'{a}}tico se han usado como entrada del modelo las series de precipitaci{\'{o}}n y temperatura del proyecto PRUDENCE para los escenarios clim{\'{a}}ticos actual y futuros A2 y B2. De los resultados de las simulaciones con TETIS se puede concluir que las aportaciones de caudal tender{\'{a}}n a disminuir en el futuro, como consecuen-cia directa de la disminuci{\'{o}}n de la precipitaci{\'{o}}n, una mayor evapotranspiraci{\'{o}}n potencial y una menor humedad del suelo en la cuenca. A pesar de la tendencia a una mayor torrencialidad de la precipitaci{\'{o}}n, los resultados del modelo indican que las crecidas tambi{\'{e}}n tienden a disminuir, de forma m{\'{a}}s pronunciada para el escenario A2 que para el escenario B2, debido a la fuerte disminuci{\'{o}}n en la humedad del suelo ya mencio-nada. Por otra parte, el transporte de sedimentos tiende a disminuir para el escenario A2 y a aumentar para el escenario B2. Esto se refleja en las tasas de aterramiento del embalse de Barasona, en el que para el esce-nario B2 no se prev{\'{e}}n modificaciones relevantes con respecto a la situaci{\'{o}}n del clima actual, mientras que para el escenario A2 se espera una vida {\'{u}}til significativamente m{\'{a}}s larga. In this study, the distributed hydrological and sedimentological model TETIS was applied in the {\'{E}}sera River catchment (Spain). The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of Climate Change on the sediment dynamics in the catchment and the siltation of Barasona reservoir that drains it. The implementation of the sediment sub-model was performed using the volumes of sediment deposited in the reservoir and measured from three historical bathymetries as reference. To analyze the effects of Climate Change, the precipitation and temperature series obtained from the PRUDENCE project, for the current and future A2 and B2 climate scenarios have been used as model inputs. From the results of the simulations with TETIS, it can be conclud-ed that the flow discharges tend to decrease in the future as a direct result of reduced precipitation, increased potential evapotranspiration and reduced soil moisture within the catchment. Despite the trend towards more torrential rainfall, model results indicate that floods will also tend to decrease, more marked-ly for the A2 scenario than for the B2 scenario, due to the large decrease in soil moisture already mentioned. Moreover, sediment transport tends to decrease for the A2 and increase for the B2 scenario. This situation is reflected in the siltation rates of Barasona reservoir, wherein for B2 no substantial changes are expected, as compared to the situation of the current climate condition, whereas for the A2 scenario a significantly longer service life is expected.},

abstract = {Having a realistic estimation of snow cover by conceptual hydrological models continues to challenge hydrologists. The calibration of the free model parameters is an unavoidable step and the uncertainties resulting from the use of this optimal set remains a source of concern, especially in forecasting applications and climate changes impact assessments. This study seeks to improve the calibration of the conceptual hydrological model GR4J coupled with the Cemaneige snow model, in order to obtain a more realistic simulation of the snow water equivalent (SWE) and to reduce the uncertainty of the free parameters. The performance of the two models was tested over twelve snow-dominated basins in southern Quebec, Canada. Four calibration strategies were adopted and compared. In the first two strategies, the parameters were calibrated against observed streamflow alone using a local and a global algorithm. In the third and fourth strategies the calibration of snow and hydrological parameters was performed against observed streamflow and snow water equivalent (SWE) measured at snow course transects, first separately, and then with a multiobjective approach. An ensemble of equifinal parameters was used to compare the capacity of the global and multiobjective algorithms to improve the parameters identifiability and to assess the impact of parameter equifinality on the temperature sensitivity of spring peak streamflow. The large number of equifinal parameters found during calibration underscores the importance of structural non-identifiability of the coupled GR4J-Cemaneige model. The inclusion of snow observations within a multiobjective calibration improved the simulation of SWE, the identifiability of the parameters and their correlation with basins characteristics. Parameter equifinality caused a small but non negligible uncertainty in the simulated response of spring peak flow to warming temperatures. Parameter equifinality should be considered in climate impact studies in snow-dominated basins where poorly constrained snow parameters can affect the temperature sensitivity of streamflow.},

We use satellite images of nocturnal lights; available as yearly snapshots from 1992 to 2013; and iden- tify five distinct distance classes from the river network position. Our results show a temporal enhancement of human presence across the considered distance classes. In particular; we observed a higher human con- centration in the vicinity of the river network; even though the frequency distribution of human beings in space has not significantly changed in the last two decades. Our results prove that fine-scale remotely sensed data; as nightlights; may provide new perspectives in water science; improving our understanding of the human impact on water resources and water-related environments.},

abstract = {Rapid land use and land-cover changes strongly affect water resources. Particularly in regions that experience seasonal water scarcity, land use scenario assessments provide a valuable basis for the evaluation of possible future water shortages. The objective of this study is to dynamically integrate land use model projections with a hydrologic model to analyze potential future impacts of land use change on the water resources of a rapidly developing catchment upstream of Pune, India. For the first time projections from the urban growth and land use change model SLEUTH are employed as a dynamic input to the hydrologic model SWAT. By this means, impacts of land use changes on the water balance components are assessed for the near future (2009-2028) employing four different climate conditions (baseline, IPCC A1B, dry, wet). The land use change modeling results in an increase of urban area by + 23.1{\%} at the fringes of Pune and by + 12.2{\%} in the upper catchment, whereas agricultural land (- 14.0{\%} and - 0.3{\%}, respectively) and semi-natural area (- 9.1{\%} and - 11.9{\%}, respectively) decrease between 2009 and 2028. Under baseline climate conditions, these land use changes induce seasonal changes in the water balance components. Water yield particularly increases at the onset of monsoon (up to + 11.0 mm per month) due to increased impervious area, whereas evapotranspiration decreases in the dry season (up to - 15.1 mm per month) as a result of the loss of irrigated agricultural area. As the projections are made for the near future (2009-2028) land use change impacts are similar under IPCC A1B climate conditions. Only if more extreme dry years occur, an exacerbation of the land use change impacts can be expected. Particularly in rapidly changing environments an implementation of both dynamic land use change and climate change seems favorable to assess seasonal and gradual changes in the water balance.},

abstract = {A numerical model simulating water uptake by root systems is presented. This model can combine the locally measured root hydraulic conductances with data on the root system architecture to give a detailed description of water absorption, from the single root level to the entire root system. This is achieved by coupling a three-dimensional root system architecture model with laws describing water flow in roots. In addition to water absorption studies, the model has been developed so that it can be included in a soil water transfer simulator in order to analyse soil-plant interactions for water uptake. The use of the model in describing water absorption is illustrated for a specific case where the hydraulic conductances are considered uniform in the whole root system. In this way, analytical results of Landsberg and Fowkes (Annals of Botany42: 493-508, 1978) are extended from the single root to the root system level. The influence of the type of root system architecture, axial conductance between crowns of maize nodal roots, transpiration in the course of the day, and non-homogeneous soil water potential on fluxes and water potentials in the root system are examined. The dynamics of the total conductance of the maize root system with plant growth is also shown for this case of uniform conductance in the root system. Cases which consider other distributions of the conductance in the root system are presented in an accompanying paper.Copyright 1998 Annals of Botany Company},

abstract = {Hydrologic model development and calibration have continued in most cases to focus only on accurately reproducing streamflows. However, complex models, for example, the so-called physically based models, possess large degrees of freedom that, if not constrained properly, may lead to poor model performance when used for prediction. We argue that constraining a model to represent streamflow, which is an integrated resultant of many factors across the watershed, is necessary but by no means sufficient to develop a high-fidelity model. To address this problem, we develop a framework to utilize the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment's (GRACE) total water storage anomaly data as a supplement to streamflows for model calibration, in a multiobjective setting. The VARS method (Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces) for global sensitivity analysis is used to understand the model behaviour with respect to streamflow and GRACE data, and the BORG multiobjective optimization method is applied for model calibration. Two subbasins of the Saskatchewan River Basin in Western Canada are used as a case study. Results show that the developed framework is superior to the conventional approach of calibration only to streamflows, even when multiple streamflow-based error functions are simultaneously minimized. It is shown that a range of (possibly false) system trajectories in state variable space can lead to similar (acceptable) model responses. This observation has significant implications for land-surface and hydrologic model development and, if not addressed properly, may undermine the credibility of the model in prediction. The framework effectively constrains the model behaviour (by constraining posterior parameter space) and results in more credible representation of hydrology across the watershed.},

Modelo de pulsos rectangulares (dependencia de Markov)
La ocurrencia de precipitaci{\'{o}}n se reproduce mediante un proceso de Poisson de par{\'{a}}metro $\lambda$. Cada rect{\'{a}}ngulo de precipitaci{\'{o}}n se define por dos par{\'{a}}metros: duraci{\'{o}}n (tr) e intensidad (ir).

Los tres par{\'{a}}metros del modelo se estiman a partir de la media, la varianza y la covarianza de las mediciones de precipitaci{\'{o}}n.
Modelo de ruido blanco de Neyman-Scott (dependencia no markoviana)
La ocurrencia de cada tormenta se define por un proceso de Poisson de par{\'{a}}metro $\lambda$. Cada tormenta se compone a su vez de una serie de pulsos instant{\'{a}}neos definidos por tres par{\'{a}}metros: el n{\'{u}}mero aleatorio de pulsos en la tormenta (vr), la posici{\'{o}}n relativa de dichos pulsos dentro de la tormenta ( Tn), y la magnitud de cada pulso (Xn). vr es una variable aleatoria de Poisson, mientras que Tn, Tn sigue una distribuci{\'{o}}n exponencial de par{\'{a}}metro $\beta$, y Xn es igualmente exponencial.
El modelo cuenta con cuatro par{\'{a}}metros: $\lambda$, $\beta$, E[X]y E[v]. Para su estimaci{\'{o}}n se toma un valor de $\beta$ y se derivan los otros tres para la media, la varianza y el coeficiente de correlaci{\'{o}}n de la precipitaci{\'{o}}n registrada. Con estos valores se calcula la covarianza estimada y se compara con la registrada. Se itera la elecci{\'{o}}n de beta hasta igualar las covarianzas.

abstract = {In this paper the ecohydrological model SWIM developed for regional impact assessment is presented, and examples of approaches to climate and land use change impact studies are described. SWIM is a continuous-time semi- distributed ecohydrological model, integrating hydrological processes, vegetation, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and sediment transport at the river basin scale. Its spatial disaggregation scheme has three levels: (1) basin, (2) sub- basins and (3) hydrotopes within sub-basins. The model was extensively tested and validated for hydrological processes, nitrogen dynamics, crop yield and erosion (mainly in mesoscale sub-basins of the German part of the Elbe River basin). After appropriate validation in representative sub-basins, the model can be applied at the regional scale for impact studies. Particular interest in the global change impact studies is given to effects of expected changes in climate and land use on hydrological processes and agro-ecosystems, including water balance components, water quality and crop yield. This paper (a) introduces the reader to the class of process-based ecohydrological catchment scale models, (b) introduces SWIM as one such model, and (c) presents two examples of impact studies performed with SWIM for the federal state of Brandenburg (Germany), which overlaps with the lowland part of the Elbe drainage area. The impact studies provide a better understanding of the complex interactions between climate, hydrological processes and vegetation, and improve our potential adaptation to the expected changes.},

abstract = {The level of model complexity that can be effectively supported by available information has long been a subject of many studies in hydrologic modelling. In particular, distributed parameter models tend to be regarded as overparameterized because of numerous parameters used to describe spatially heterogeneous hydrologic processes. However, it is not clear how parameters and observations influence the degree of overparameterization, equifinality of parameter values, and uncertainty. This study investigated the impact of the numbers of observations and parameters on calibration quality including equifinality among calibrated parameter values, model performance, and output/parameter uncertainty using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model. In the experiments, the number of observations was increased by expanding the calibration period or by including measurements made at inner points of a watershed. Similarly, additional calibration parameters were included in the order of their sensitivity. Then, unique sets of parameters were calibrated with the same objective function, optimization algorithm, and stopping criteria but different numbers of observations. The calibration quality was quantified with statistics calculated based on the ‘behavioural' parameter sets, identified using 1{\%} and 5{\%} cut-off thresholds in a generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation framework. The study demonstrated that equifinality, model performance, and output/parameter uncertainty were responsive to the numbers of observations and calibration parameters; however, the relationship between the numbers, equifinality, and uncertainty was not always conclusive. Model performance improved with increased numbers of calibration parameters and observations, and substantial equifinality did neither necessarily mean bad model performance nor large uncertainty in the model outputs and parameters.

abstract = {This paper describes a case study that explores the limits of the predictability of floods, by combining forecasts with multiple spatial and temporal resolutions. Monthly, medium- and short range numerical weather prediction (NWP) data are input to the European Flood Alert System for a flood event that affected rivers in Romania in October 2007. The NWP data comprise ensembles and deterministic forecasts of different spatial resolutions and lead times from different weather prediction models. Results are explored in terms of the individual NWP components as well as the ensemble. In this case study, ensembles of monthly weather forecasts contribute only marginally to the early warning, although some indication is given as early as 3 weeks before the event. The 15-day medium-range weather forecasts produce early flood warning information 9 to 11 days in advance. As the event draws nearer and is in range to be captured by the higher resolution ensemble forecasts, the spatial extent of the event is forecast with much more precision than with the medium-range. A novel post-processing method for the calculation of river discharge is applied to those stations where observations are available, and is able to correct for time-shifts and to improve the quantitative forecast. The study illustrates how a combination of forecasts and post-processing improves the lead time for early flood warnings by 2 to 3 days, while remaining reliable also in the short-range. {\textcopyright} 2009 Royal Meteorological Society.},

Conclusions:
Monthly forecasts can indicate potential flooding with 3-4 weeks in advance, but without a precise location in space and time.
Medium-range forecasts show good results qualitative and quantitatively, being able to predict floods 7-9 days in advance.
Deterministic forecasts are less coherent than probabilistic ones. This is applicable both at medium and short-range forecasts.

However, it is impossible to observe directly at catchment scale. Here, using data from 300 diverse catchments, it was tested that, treating the root zone as a reservoir, the mass curve technique (MCT), an engineering method for reservoir design, can be used to estimate catchment-scale S-R from effective rainfall and plant transpiration. Supporting the initial hypothesis, it was found that MCT-derived S-R coincided with model-derived estimates. These estimates of parameter S-R can be used to constrain hydrological, climate, and land surface models. Further, the study provides evidence that ecosystems dynamically design their root systems to bridge droughts with return periods of 10-40years, controlled by climate and linked to aridity index, inter-storm duration, seasonality, and runoff ratio.},

abstract = {Baseflow is the portion of streamflow that comes from shallow and deep subsurface flow, and is the key for catchment ecology and water resource management. This paper comprehensively evaluates four widely used non-tracer baseflow separation methods against tracer-based hydrograph separation for five Eastern Australian catchments. The four methods include United Kingdom Institute of Hydrology (UKIH) method and three digital filtering methods: Lyne–Hollick method, Chapman–Maxwell method and Eckhardt method. The first two filtering methods include a parameter of recession constant, and the last one has two parameters: the recession constant and the maximum baseflow index. We used an Automatic Baseflow Identification Technique (ABIT) to estimate the recession constant, which varies from 0.943 to 0.987 for the five catchments that is evidently higher than the default value of 0.925, and used the default Eckhardt and UKIH methods to estimate the maximum baseflow index, respectively. All modelling results are evaluated against the tracer-based hydrograph separation. Using the recession constant estimated from the ABIT method performs noticeably better than using the default parameter, indicated by the absolute bias reduced about 20{\%} in average. For the two-parameter Eckhardt method, estimating the maximum baseflow index has larger effect on baseflow separation than estimating the recession constant. Compared to the different parameterisation schemes, the difference among the improved non-tracer methods is small. Using multiple passes into the Lyne–Hollick method can only slightly improve or deteriorate baseflow index estimates. Our results suggest that it is critical to get appropriate parameter(s) before applying the digital filtering methods.},

This transition in plant dominance is often explained as a state shift in bistable ecosystemdynamics induced by fire-vegetation feedbacks. These feedbacks occur when woody plants are able to displace grasses because of their better access to soil water and light. On the other hand, grasses can displace woody plants because of their ability to increase fire frequency and of the higher susceptibility of woody plants to fire-induced mortality. In this study, we present an ecohydrological framework to investigate the displacement of grasses by woody plants. Considering the effect of lateral root spread and of soil water and light limitations, we found that woody plant encroachment can substantially suppress grass production even without the presence of grazers.

En ambientes secos, el factor limitante para los pastos es la disponibilidad de agua, mientras que en ambiente m{\'{a}}s humedos lo es la luz.
- Se ha descubierto una din{\'{a}}mica biestable caracterizada por tres estados: dos estados extremos estables correspondientes a pastos o bosque/savana, y un estado inestable intermedio que puede derivar en alguno de los dos anteriores.
- La precipitaci{\'{o}}n media anual es un par{\'{a}}metro clave en la din{\'{a}}mica biestable:

abstract = {Lakes and reservoirs affect the timing and magnitude of streamflow, and are therefore essential hydrological model components, especially in the context of global flood forecasting. However, the parameterization of lake and reservoir routines on a global scale is subject to considerable uncertainty due to lack of information on lake hydrographic characteristics and reservoir operating rules. In this study we estimated the effect of lakes and reservoirs on global daily streamflow simulations of a spatially-distributed LISFLOOD hydrological model. We applied state-of-the-art global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses for selected catchments to examine the effect of uncertain lake and reservoir parameterization on model performance. Streamflow observations from 390 catchments around the globe and multiple performance measures were used to assess model performance. Results indicate a considerable geographical variability in the lake and reservoir effects on the streamflow simulation. Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) metrics improved for 65{\%} and 38{\%} of catchments respectively, with median skill score values of 0.16 and 0.2 while scores deteriorated for 28{\%} and 52{\%} of the catchments, with median values −0.09 and −0.16, respectively. The effect of reservoirs on extreme high flows was substantial and widespread in the global domain, while the effect of lakes was spatially limited to a few catchments. As indicated by global sensitivity analysis, parameter uncertainty substantially affected uncertainty of model performance. Reservoir parameters often contributed to this uncertainty, although the effect varied widely among catchments. The effect of reservoir parameters on model performance diminished with distance downstream of reservoirs in favor of other parameters, notably groundwater-related parameters and channel Manning's roughness coefficient. This study underscores the importance of accounting for lakes and, especially, reservoirs and using appropriate parameterization in large-scale hydrological simulations.},

In the end, they included in GloFAS 463 lakes (A {\textgreater} 100 km², main river channel and non-endorheic), and 667 reservoirs.

Daily streamflow data:
* Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC): 390 stations downstream of lakes/reservoirs,  A {\textgreater} 10,000 km², and 4 years of data.

Meteo:
ERA-Interim/Land dataset bias-corrected with Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP).
Methods
The tested 3 scenarios:
* No lakes nore reservoirs.
* Only lakes.
* Lakes and reservoirs.
They analysed for this scenarios the effects on the hydrological performance (NSE, KGE, r, PBIAS), and on the 5 and 20 year return period.

The global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses had 3 steps:
1. Screening using the modified method of Morris.
2. The variance-based global sensitivity analysis method of Sobol.
3. Uncertainty analysis.

Results
The main effect of lakes is the attenuation of peaks and delayed timing due to detention and evaporation. It's inclusion improved the simulation skill, but the effect on the performance metris was small. The effect on the return levels is limited to a few catchments, approximating the simulated values to the observed ones.

The reservoirs affected considerably the simulated streamflo. The performance of the model was also more affected by the inclusion of reservoirs than lakes. The authors mention that the current reservoir routine is focused only in flood control, whereas other uses are disregarded. The inclusion of reservoirs affected the return flows in many catchments, producing sometimes and overestimation of return levels. The authors mention that the current rules may not represent real-world operating rules.

The uncertainty analysis proved that there's considerable uncertainty propagating from the model parameters:
* The routing parameter CCm has a strong influence on the streamflow performance. In some catchments the groundwater parameters (GwL, GwPV, UZTC, LZTC) are highly influencial.
* The effect of the reservoir parameters is stronger in stations right downstream the reservoir. The parameters related to normal conditions (rnormq, rnlim) are the most important.
* The authors mention a lack of representation of processes reducing the amount of water (wetlands).},

abstract = {In the estimation of distribution of annual maximum flows it is a generally accepted assumption that the sequence of observations originates from a homogeneous population. This assumption, however, is rarely met. The observed annual maximum flow are only in part generated by flood events. The remaining ones are the result of the effect of other hydrological processes that do not have that character. For this reason, a new solution to this problem is proposed in the paper. It is assumed that the sought distribution is a mixture of two probability distributions: a three-parameter GEV distribution, describing flows generated by events with flood character, and a two-parameter gamma distribution, accounting for maximum annual flows that do not have such a character. The paper presents both the method of estimation of the mixture distribution and its application for gauging stations selected so as to take into account possible the most diverse conditions of meteorological, hydrological and geomorphological character. The area with such a high diversification, selected for the study, is the catchment basin of upper and central river Odra (South-West Poland). In the studied water gauge profiles the proposed mixture distribution indicates correct fit. Its advantages and limitations are presented through a comparative analysis with results obtained during estimation of distributions of maximum annual flows by means of standard methods.},

Nevertheless, SDM projections are affected by a wide range of uncertainty factors (related to training data, climate projections and SDM techniques), which limit their potential value and credibility. The new package mopa provides tools for designing comprehensive multi-factor SDM ensemble experiments, combining multiple sources of uncertainty (e.g. baseline climate, pseudo-absence realizations, SDM techniques, future projections) and allowing to assess their contribution to the overall spread of the ensemble projection. In addition, mopa is seamlessly integrated with the climate4R bundle and allows straightforward retrieval and post-processing of state-of-the-art climate datasets (including observations and climate change projections), thus facilitating the proper analysis of key uncertainty factors related to climate data.},

abstract = {For many years now, modelling tools have been available to simulate spatially dis- tributed hydrological processes. These tools have been used for testing hypotheses about the behaviour of natural systems, for practical applications such as erosion and transport modelling, and for simulation of the effect of land use and climate change. However, so far the quality of the simulations and spatial process represen- tations has been difficult to assess because of a lack of appropriate field data. Spatial Patterns in Catchment Hydrology: Observations and Modelling brings together a number of recent field exercises in research catchments, that illustrate how the understanding and modelling capability of spatial processes can be improved by the use of observed patterns of hydrological response. In addition the introductory chapters review the nature of the hydrological variability, and introduce basic concepts related to measuring and modelling spatial hydrologic processes. This introductory material provides the conceptual and theoretical background needed to move into this exciting area of research for a general earth sciences/water engineering audience. The book demonstrates that there is rich information in patterns that provide much more stringent tests of the models and much greater insight into hydrological behaviour than traditional methods. Written in an intuitive and coherent manner, the book is ideal for researchers, graduate students and advanced undergraduates in hydrology, and a range of water related disciplines such as physical geography, earth sciences, and environ- mental and civil engineering as related to water resources and hydrology.},

abstract = {We studied water uptake variability at the plant scale using a three-dimensional detailed model. Specifically, we investigated the sensitivity of the R-SWMS model under different plant collar conditions by comparing computed water fluxes, flow variability, and soil water distributions for different case scenarios and different parameterizations. The relative radial root conductivity and soil hydraulic conductivity were shown to control the plant water extraction distribution. Highly conductive soils promote water uptake but at the same time decrease the variability of the soil water content. A large radial root conductivity increases the amount of water extracted by the root and generates very heterogeneous water extraction profiles. Increasing the xylem conductivity has less impact because the xylem is generally the most conductive part of the system. It was also determined that, due to the different magnitudes of soil and root conductivities, similar one-dimensional sink-term profiles can result in very different water content and flux distributions at the plant scale. Furthermore, an analysis based on soil texture showed that the ability of a soil to sustain high plant transpiration demand cannot be predicted a priori from the soil hydraulic properties only, as it depends on the evaporative demand and on the three-dimensional distributions of the soil/root conductivity ratio and soil capacity, which continuously evolve with time. Combining soil and root hydraulic properties led to very complex one-dimensional sink functions that are quite different from the simple reduction functions usually found in the literature. The R-SWMS model could be used to develop more realistic one-dimensional reduction functi},

abstract = {Leaves within a canopy may experience rapid and extreme fluctuations in ambient conditions. A shaded leaf, for example, may become exposed to an order of magnitude increase in solar radiation within a few seconds, due to sunflecks or canopy motions. Considering typical time scales for stomatal adjustments, (2 to 60 minutes), the gap between these two time scales raised the question whether leaves rely on their hydraulic and thermal capacitances for passive protection from hydraulic failure or over-heating until stomata have adjusted. We employed a physically based model to systematically study effects of short-term fluctuations in irradiance on leaf temperatures and transpiration rates. Considering typical amplitudes and time scales of such fluctuations, the importance of leaf heat and water capacities for avoiding damaging leaf temperatures and hydraulic failure were investigated. The results suggest that common leaf heat capacities are not sufficient to protect a non-transpiring leaf from over-heating during sunflecks of several minutes duration whereas transpirative cooling provides effective protection. A comparison of the simulated time scales for heat damage in the absence of evaporative cooling with observed stomatal response times suggested that stomata must be already open before arrival of a sunfleck to avoid over-heating to critical leaf temperatures. This is consistent with measured stomatal conductances in shaded leaves and has implications for water use efficiency of deep canopy leaves and vulnerability to heat damage during drought. Our results also suggest that typical leaf water contents could sustain several minutes of evaporative cooling during a sunfleck without increasing the xylem water supply and thus risking embolism. We thus submit that shaded leaves rely on hydraulic capacitance and evaporative cooling to avoid over-heating and hydraulic failure during exposure to typical sunflecks, whereas thermal capacitance provides limited protection for very short sunflecks (tens of seconds). {\textcopyright} 2013 Schymanski et al.},

abstract = {The process of model evaluation is not only an integral part of model development and calibration but also of paramount importance when communicating modelling results to the scientific community and stakeholders. The modelling community has a large and well-tested toolbox of metrics to evaluate temporal model performance. In contrast, spatial performance evaluation does not correspond to the grand availability of spatial observations readily available and to the sophisticate model codes simulating the spatial variability of complex hydrological processes. This study makes a contribution towards advancing spatial-pattern-oriented model calibration by rigorously testing a multiple-component performance metric. The promoted SPAtial EFficiency (SPAEF) metric reflects three equally weighted components: correlation, coefficient of variation and histogram overlap. This multiple-component approach is found to be advantageous in order to achieve the complex task of comparing spatial patterns. SPAEF, its three components individually and two alternative spatial performance metrics, i.e. connectivity analysis and fractions skill score, are applied in a spatial-pattern-oriented model calibration of a catchment model in Denmark. Results suggest the importance of multiple-component metrics because stand-alone metrics tend to fail to provide holistic pattern information. The three SPAEF components are found to be independent, which allows them to complement each other in a meaningful way. In order to optimally exploit spatial observations made available by remote sensing platforms, this study suggests applying bias insensitive metrics which further allow for a comparison of variables which are related but may differ in unit. This study applies SPAEF in the hydrological context using the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM; version 5.8), but we see great potential across disciplines related to spatially distributed earth system modelling.},
annote = {Objetivo:
Crear una nueva m{\'{e}}trica multicomponente capaz de comparar el patr{\'{o}}n espacial de una variable simulada por un modelo hidrol{\'{o}}gico distribuido con las observaciones por sensores remotos. 

Metodolog{\'{i}}a:
Se desarrolla el criterio SPAEF (spatial efficiency), una m{\'{e}}trica inspirada en el coeficiente de eficiencia de Kling y Gupta (KGE). SPAEF est{\'{a}} basada en tres componentes de igual peso: la correlaci{\'{o}}n, el cociente de los coeficientes de variaci{\'{o}}n y el z-score de solape de los histogramas. Al igual que KGE, SPAEF es la distancia euclidea de estos tres componentes a su valor {\'{o}}ptimo.

SPAEF se compara contra otros cinco criterios de optimizaci{\'{o}}n: los tres criterios incluidos en SPAEF independientemente, la conectividad y "fractions skill score".

Como modelo hidrol{\'{o}}gico se usa el mHM (Mesoscale Hydrological Model). El estudio se centra en la cuenca del r{\'{i}}o Skjern. Inicialmente se hizo un an{\'{a}}lisis de sensibilidad del que se extrajeron los 17 par{\'{a}}metros m{\'{a}}s sensibles. La calibraci{\'{o}}n se hizo utilizando PEST y SCE-UA. En la calibraci{\'{o}}n se tiene en cuenta tanto la representatividad temporal, KGE de los hidrogramas observados en dos puntos, como la espacial (SPAEF, FSS...); a este {\'{u}}ltimo se le da 5 veces m{\'{a}}s peso.

Teor{\'{i}}as e hip{\'{o}}tesis:
Los modelos hidrol{\'{o}}gicos distribuidos deben de ser calibrados no s{\'{o}}lo temporalmente, sino tambi{\'{e}}n espacialmente. Para ello es necesario generar una m{\'{e}}trica capaz de evaluar la correcci{\'{o}}n en los patrones espaciales simulados.

Resultados:
- Las diferencias en los patrones de las seis calibraciones son importantes, encontr{\'{a}}ndose cierta similitud entre las tres m{\'{e}}tricas con restricciones locales: SPAEF, correlaci{\'{o}}n y FSS.
- El juicio de experto identifica a SPAEF como el mejor criterio de los 6.
- A pesar de las importantes diferencias en los patrones espaciales, todas las calibraciones obtienen un hidrograma casi id{\'{e}}ntico.

Limitaciones:
Las variables espaciales simuladas y observadas deben tener una relaci{\'{o}}n lineal puesto que as{\'{i}} lo asume la correlaci{\'{o}}n (uno de los tres componentes de SPAEF). En caso contrario, deber{\'{a}} transformarse una de las variables para que se cumpla la linearidad.
La insensibilidad al sesgo de SPAEF elimina los problemas que pudiera conllevar la incertidumbre de las observaciones. Sin embargo, esto podr{\'{i}}a ser un problema en modelos sin sesgo.

abstract = {Distributed hydrologic models which link seasonal streamflow and soil moisture patterns with spatial patterns of vegetation are important tools for understanding the sensitivity of Mediterranean type ecosystems to future climate and land use change. RHESSys (Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System) is a coupled spatially distributed hydroecological model that is designed to be able to represent these feedbacks between hydrologic and vegetation carbon and nutrient cycling processes. However, RHESSys has not previously been applied to semiarid shrubland watersheds. In this study, the hydrologic submodel of RHESSys is evaluated by comparing model predictions of monthly and annual streamflow to stream gage data and by comparing RHESSys behavior to that of another hydrologic model of similar complexity, MIKESHE, for a 34 km(2) watershed near Santa Barbara, California. In model intercomparison, the differences in predictions of temporal patterns in streamflow, sensitivity of model predictions to calibration parameters and landscape representation, and differences in model estimates of soil moisture patterns are explored. Results from this study show that both models adequately predict seasonal patterns of streamflow response relative to observed data, but differ significantly in terms of estimates of soil moisture patterns and sensitivity of those patterns to the scale of landscape tessellation used to derive spatially distributed elements. This sensitivity has implications for implementing RHESSys as a tool to investigate interactions between hydrology and ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {The calibration of hydrological models without streamflow observations is problematic, and the simultaneous, combined use of remotely sensed products for this purpose has not been exhaustively tested thus far. Our hypothesis is that the combined use of products can (1) reduce the parameter search space and (2) improve the representation of internal model dynamics and hydrological signatures. Five different conceptual hydrological models were applied to 27 catchments across Europe. A parameter selection process, similar to a likelihood weighting procedure, was applied for 1,023 possible combinations of 10 different data sources, ranging from using 1 to all 10 of these products. Distances between the two empirical distributions of model performance metrics with and without using a specific product were determined to assess the added value of a specific product. In a similar way, the performance of the models to reproduce 27 hydrological signatures was evaluated relative to the unconstrained model. Significant reductions in the parameter space were obtained when combinations included Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer ‐ Earth Observing System and Advanced Scatterometer soil moisture, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment total water storage anomalies, and, in snow‐dominated catchments, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer snow cover products. The evaporation products of Land Surface Analysis ‐ Satellite Application Facility and MOD16 were less effective for deriving meaningful, well‐constrained posterior parameter distributions. The hydrological signature analysis indicated that most models profited from constraining with an increasing number of data sources. Concluding, constraining models with multiple data sources simultaneously was shown to be valuable for at least four of the five hydrological models to determine model parameters in absence of streamflow.},

abstract = {The quantification of carbon fluxes between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere is of scientific importance and also relevant to climate-policy making. Eddy covariance flux towers provide continuous measurements of ecosystem-level exchange of carbon dioxide spanning diurnal, synoptic, seasonal, and interannual time scales. However, these measurements only represent the fluxes at the scale of the tower footprint. Here we used remotely sensed data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to upscale gross primary productivity (GPP) data from eddy covariance flux towers to the continental scale. We first combined GPP and MODIS data for 42 AmeriFlux towers encompassing a wide range of ecosystem and climate types to develop a predictive GPP model using a regression tree approach. The predictive model was trained using observed GPP over the period 2000-2004, and was validated using observed GPP over the period 2005-2006 and leave-one-out cross-validation. Our model predicted GPP fairly well at the site level. We then used the model to estimate GPP for each 1 km × 1 km cell across the U.S. for each 8-day interval over the period from February 2000 to December 2006 using MODIS data. Our GPP estimates provide a spatially and temporally continuous measure of gross primary production for the U.S. that is a highly constrained by eddy covariance flux data. Our study demonstrated that our empirical approach is effective for upscaling eddy flux GPP data to the continental scale and producing continuous GPP estimates across multiple biomes. With these estimates, we then examined the patterns, magnitude, and interannual variability of GPP. We estimated a gross carbon uptake between 6.91 and 7.33 Pg C yr- 1for the conterminous U.S. Drought, fires, and hurricanes reduced annual GPP at regional scales and could have a significant impact on the U.S. net ecosystem carbon exchange. The sources of the interannual variability of U.S. GPP were dominated by these extreme climate events and disturbances. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The choice for specific parameter estimation methods is often more dependent on its availability than its performance. We developed SPOTPY (Statistical Parameter Optimization Tool), an open source python package containing a comprehensive set of methods typically used to calibrate, analyze and optimize parameters for a wide range of ecological models. SPOTPY currently contains eight widely used algorithms, 11 objective functions, and can sample from eight parameter distributions. SPOTPY has a model-independent structure and can be run in parallel from the workstation to large computation clusters using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). We tested SPOTPY in five different case studies to parameterize the Rosenbrock, Griewank and Ackley functions, a one-dimensional physically based soil moisture routine, where we searched for parameters of the van Genuchten-Mualem function and a calibration of a biogeochemistry model with different objective functions. The case studies reveal that the implemented SPOTPY methods can be used for any model with just a minimal amount of code for maximal power of parameter optimization. They further show the benefit of having one package at hand that includes number of well performing parameter search methods, since not every case study can be solved sufficiently with every algorithm or every objective function.},

The original data were quality-controlled and gaps were filled on each day and location independently. Using the serially complete dataset, a grid with a 5 × 5 km spatial resolution was constructed by estimating daily precipitation amounts and their corresponding uncertainty at each grid node. Daily precipitation estimations were compared to original observations to assess the quality of the gridded dataset. Four daily precipitation indices were computed to characterise the spatial distribution of daily precipitation and nine extreme precipitation indices were used to describe the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events. The Mediterranean coast and the Central Range showed the highest frequency and intensity of extreme events, while the number of wet days and dry and wet spells followed a north-west to south-east gradient in peninsular Spain, from high to low values in the number of wet days and wet spells and reverse in dry spells. The use of the total available data in Spain, the independent estimation of precipitation for each day and the high spatial resolution of the grid allowed for a precise spatial and temporal assessment of daily precipitation that is difficult to achieve when using other methods, pre-selected long-term stations or global gridded datasets.

abstract = {The USDA Soil Conservation Service (USDA-SCS) realized the importance of understanding hydrologic processes on agricultural fields and watersheds in the mid-1950s. Based on this realization, the research program of the Hydrologic Division of SCS established three experimental watersheds across the U.S. to analyze the impact of landuse practices on soil erosion, flood events, water resources, and the agricultural economy. Two of the original watersheds remain in operation today within the USDA Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS): the Blacklands Experimental Watershed (now the Grassland, Soil and Water Research Laboratory) near Riesel, Texas, and the North Appalachian Experimental Watershed near Coshocton, Ohio. These original watersheds were designed for collection of hydrologic data on small watersheds and evaluation of hydrologic and soil loss response as influenced by various agricultural land management practices. A major contribution of these experimental watersheds is the quantification of soil loss reduction under conservation management, which has led to a drastic reduction in soil loss from cultivated agriculture in the 20th century. Riesel watershed studies produced the scientific basis for several watershed models that are now used worldwide to manage water quality and also facilitated fundamental analysis of the agronomic and environmental effects of tillage, fertilizer, and pesticide alternatives. Coshocton watershed studies led to the development of no-till and pasture management practices to control runoff, erosion, and chemical loss and were instrumental in understanding water quality and hydrologic effects of soil macropores and mining and reclamation activities. The long-term hydrologic records at each site have also improved understanding and management of water resources in their respective geographic, regions. Because of their historical and future value, the USDA-ARS has a unique responsibility to maintain these long-term experimental watersheds, which are vital for addressing emerging research needs to meet future water availability, environmental quality, and food and fiber demands.

abstract = {River discharge predictions often show errors that degrade the quality of forecasts. Three different methods of error correction are compared, namely, an autoregressive model with and without exogenous input (ARX and AR, respectively), and a method based on wavelet transforms. For the wavelet method, a Vector-Autoregressive model with exogenous input (VARX) is simultaneously fitted for the different levels of wavelet decomposition; after predicting the next time steps for each scale, a reconstruction formula is applied to transform the predictions in the wavelet domain back to the original time domain. The error correction methods are combined with the Hydrological Uncertainty Processor (HUP) in order to estimate the predictive conditional distribution. For three stations along the Danube catchment, and using output from the European Flood Alert System (EFAS), we demonstrate that the method based on wavelets outperforms simpler methods and uncorrected predictions with respect to mean absolute error, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (and its decomposed performance criteria), informativeness score, and in particular forecast reliability. The wavelet approach efficiently accounts for forecast errors with scale properties of unknown source and statistical structure. Copyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {As a result of a new agricultural funding policy established in 1992 by the European Community, it was assumed that up to 15–20{\%} of arable land would have been set aside in the next years in the new federal states of north-eastern Germany, for example, Brandenburg. As one potential land use option, afforestation of these set aside areas was discussed to obtain deciduous forests. Since the mean annual precipitation in north-eastern Germany, Brandenburg is relatively low (480–530 mmy−1), an increase in interception and evapotranspiration loss by forests compared to arable land would lead to a reduction in ground water recharge. Experimental evidence to determine effects of such land use changes are rarely available. Therefore, there is a need for indirect methods to estimate the impact of afforestation on the water balance of catchments. In this paper, a conceptual hydrological model was verified and calibrated in two steps using data from the Stobber-catchment located in Brandenburg. In the first step, model outputs like daily evapotranspiration rates and soil water contents were verified on the basis of experimental data sets from two test locations. One test site with the land use arable land was located within the Stobber-catchment. The other test site with pine forest was located near by the catchment. In the second step, the model was used to estimate the impact of afforestation on catchment water balance and discharge. For that purpose, the model was calibrated against daily discharge measurements for the period 1995–1997. For a simple afforestation scenario, it was assumed that the area of forest increases from 34{\%} up to 80{\%} of the catchment area. The impact of this change in forest cover proportion was analyzed using the calibrated model. In case of increasing the proportion of forest cover in the catchment due to the scenario afforestation, the model predicts a reduction in discharge and an increase in evapotranspiration.},

Se utiliza un modelo hidrol{\'{o}}gico conceptual para evaluar el impacto que producir{\'{i}}a la aforestaci{\'{o}}n de una cuenca hidrogr{\'{a}}fica en el noreste de Alemania (bajo las mismas series clim{\'{a}}ticas). 

Teor{\'{i}}as e hip{\'{o}}tesis:
Modelo THESEUS
Modelo hidrol{\'{o}}gico semidistribuido con interfaz GIS que usa tres coverturas: hidrotopos, subcuencas y red de drenaje. Tiene tres submodelos:

1. Modelo semiemp{\'{i}}rico de las plantas.
Calcula la evaporaci{\'{o}}n real y su partici{\'{o}}n en transpiraci{\'{o}}n, evaporaci{\'{o}}n e intercepci{\'{o}}n utilizando funciones temporales de la profundidad de ra{\'{i}}z, altura de la planta y covertura del suelo espec{\'{i}}ficas para cada cultivo.

2. Modelo de la humedad del suelo.
Se divide el perfil del suelo en capas de 10 cm. El modelo calcula la infiltraci{\'{o}}n (modelo Holtan), la escorrent{\'{i}}a superficial, la percolaci{\'{o}}n entre capas y la recarga del acu{\'{i}}fero.

3. Flujos de agua.
La escorrent{\'{i}}a superficial y la recarga del acu{\'{i}}fero de cada subcuenca se agregan a partir del balance de cada hidrotopo a partir de un embalses lineales (r{\'{a}}pido para la escorrent{\'{i}}a y lento para la recarga).
El flujo en la red de drenaje se modela seg{\'{u}}n una cascada de embalses lineales.

Metodolog{\'{i}}a:
Calibraci{\'{o}}n
- Calibraci{\'{o}}n de la evapotranspiraci{\'{o}}n y la humedad del suelo para suelo cultivado y bosque.
- Calibraci{\'{o}}n del caudal en una estaci{\'{o}}n de aforo dentro de la cuenca. Se calibran los coeficientes de los dos embalses lineales y la reducci{\'{o}}n de la conductividad hidr{\'{a}}ulica saturada.
Como medidas de la calidad del modelo se utilizan el {\'{i}}ndice de eficiencia de Willmott (IA) y la ra{\'{i}}z del error cuadr{\'{a}}tico medio (SRMQE).

Simulaci{\'{o}}n
El modelo calibrado se utiliza para simular los componentes del balance h{\'{i}}drico a partir de las mismas series temporales pero para una distribuci{\'{o}}n de usos del suelo distinta (80{\%} de bosque en vez del 34{\%} real). Estos resultados se comparan con la simulaci{\'{o}}n seg{\'{u}}n el uso real del suelo.

Resultados:
Calibraci{\'{o}}n:
- La evapotranspiraci{\'{o}}n y la humedad del suelo simulada representa correctamente las mediciones.
- La simulaci{\'{o}}n de caudales representa correctamente los caudales aforados.

Simulaci{\'{o}}n:
Se produce un aumento de la transpiraci{\'{o}}n y una reducci{\'{o}}n del caudal del 39-41 {\%} para el escenario con aumento de la superficie de bosque.

Limitaciones:
- La estaci{\'{o}}n de aforos con la que se calibra el modelo s{\'{o}}lo cubre un 65{\%} de la cuenca.

abstract = {We simulate the water balance dynamics of 308 catchments in Austria using a lumped conceptual model involving 11 calibration parameters. We calibrate and verify the model for two non-overlapping 11-year periods of daily runoff data. A comparison of the calibrated parameter values of the two periods suggests that all parameters are associated with some uncertainty although the degree of uncertainty differs between the parameters. The regional patterns of the calibrated parameters can be interpreted based on hydrological process reasoning indicating that they are able to represent the regional or large-scale differences in the hydrological conditions. Catchment attributes explain some of the spatial parameter variability with coefficients of determination of up to R2=0.27, but usually the R2values are lower. Parameter uncertainty does not seem to cloud the relationship between calibrated parameters and catchment attributes to a significant extent as suggested by an optimised correlation analysis. The median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies of simulating streamflow decrease from 0.67 to 0.63 when moving from the calibration to the verification period. This is a small decrease, which suggests that problems with over-parameterisation of the model are unlikely. We then compare regionalisation methods for estimating the model parameters in ungauged catchments, in terms of the model performance. The best regionalisation methods are the use of the average parameters of immediate upstream and downstream (nested) neighbours and regionalisation by kriging. For the calibration period, the average decrease in the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency, as a result of the regionalisation, is 0.10 which is about twice the decrease of moving from the calibration to the verification period. The methods based on multiple regressions with catchment attributes perform significantly poorer. Apparently, spatial proximity is a better surrogate of unknown controls on runoff dynamics than catchment attributes. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many land surface schemes and simulation mod- els of plant growth designed for practical use employ simple empirical sub-models of root water uptake that cannot ad- equately reflect the critical role water uptake from sparsely rooted deep subsoil plays in meeting atmospheric transpira- tion demand in water-limited environments, especially in the presence of shallow groundwater. A failure to account for this so-called “compensatory”water uptake may have serious consequences for both local and global modeling of water and energy fluxes, carbon balances and climate. Some purely empirical compensatory root water uptake models have been proposed, but they are of limited use in global modeling ex- ercises since their parameters cannot be related to measur- able soil and vegetation properties. A parsimonious physics- based model of uptake compensation has been developed that requires no more parameters than empirical approaches. This model is described and some aspects of its behavior are illus- trated with the help of example simulations. These analy- ses demonstrate that hydraulic lift can be considered as an extreme form of compensation and that the degree of com- pensation is principally a function of soil capillarity and the ratio of total effective root length to potential transpiration. Thus, uptake compensation increases as root to leaf area ra- tios increase, since potential transpiration depends on leaf area. Results of “scenario” simulations for two case stud- ies, one at the local scale (riparian vegetation growing above shallow water tables in seasonally dry or arid climates) and one at a global scale (water balances across an aridity gradi- ent in the continental USA), are presented to illustrate biases in model predictions that arise whenwater uptake compensa- tion is neglected. In the first case, it is shown that only a com- pensated model can match the strong relationships between water table depth and leaf area and transpiration observed in riparian forest ecosystems, where sparse roots in the capillary fringe contribute a significant proportion of the water uptake during extended dry periods. The results of the second case study suggest that uncompensated models may give biased estimates of long-term evapotranspiration at the continental scale. In the example presented here, the uncompensated model underestimated total evapotranspiration by 5–7{\%} in climates of intermediate aridity, while the ratio of transpira- tion to evaporationwas also smaller than for the compensated model, especially in arid climates. It is concluded that the parsimonious physics-based model concepts described here may be useful in the context of eco-hydrological modeling at local, regional and global scales.},

abstract = {A new method of participatory decision support that can be used in transboundary basins is presented. The framework of this method relies first on the creation of a transboundary geographic information system database to store hydrologic data and allow easy access to data from stakeholders. A participatory hydro-political framework is developed to help set up hydrologic models and evaluate joint water management scenarios. Results show that the countries of the Jordan River could benefit from the framework and in the case of southern Lebanon, six climate stations should be replaced or reactivated. Finally, the mechanism of a Lebanese Hydrologic Information System is presented and shows that an observation data model will facilitate science and policy integration. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Application of machine learning models to study land-cover change is typically restricted to the change detection of categorical, i.e. classified, land-cover data. In this study, our aim is to extend the utility of such models to predict the spectral band information of satellite images. A Random Forests (RF)-based machine learning model is trained using topographic and historical climatic variables as inputs to predict the spectral band values of high-resolution satellite imagery across two large sites in the western United States, New Mexico (10,570 km2), and Washington (9400 km2). The model output is used to obtain a true colour photorealistic image and an image showing the normalized difference vegetation index values. We then use the trained model to explore what the land cover might look like for a climate change scenario during the 2061–2080 period. The RF model achieves high validation accuracy for both sites during the training phase, with the coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.79 for New Mexico site and R2 = 0.73 for Washington site. For the climate change scenario, prominent land-cover changes are characterized by an increase in the vegetation cover at the New Mexico site and a decrease in the perennial snow cover at the Washington site. Our results suggest that direct prediction of spectral band information is highly beneficial due to the ability it provides for deriving ecologically relevant products, which can be used to analyse land-cover change scenarios from multiple perspectives.},

abstract = {This paper investigates how using different regional climate model (RCM) simulations affects climate change impacts on hydrology in northern Europe using an offline hydrological model. Climate change scenarios from an ensemble of seven RCMs, two global climate models (GCMs), two global emissions scenarios and two RCMs of varying resolution were used. A total of 15 climate change simulations were included in studies on the Lule River basin in Northern Sweden. Two different approaches to transfer climate change from the RCMs to hydrological models were tested. A rudimentary estimate of change in hydropower potential on the Lule River due to climate change was also made. The results indicate an overall increase in river flow, earlier spring peak flows and an increase in hydropower potential. The two approaches for transferring the signal of climate change to the hydrological impacts model gave similar mean results, but considerably different seasonal dynamics, a result that is highly relevant for other types of climate change impacts studies.},

abstract = {This study investigated whether the regional hydro-ecological simulation system RHESSys is a suitable tool for long-term global change impact studies under selected climatic conditions of Europe, taking advantage of the strongly varying climate along elevational gradients in mountain regions. We performed a validation of RHESSys using daily, monthly and yearly data on (1) streamflow and snow cover in five Alpine catchments and (2) water and carbon fluxes at 15 EUROFLUX sites. The simulation results generally agreed well with observations. RHESSys reasonably reproduced daily and monthly streamflow, as well as the seasonal cycle and amplitude of typical Alpine discharge regimes. Furthermore, RHESSys was capable of capturing the key features of the carbon cycle of various forested ecosystems, including significant differences between managed and close-to-natural forests, and more subtle distinctions between coniferous and deciduous systems. Our analyses confirmed that RHESSys is a suitable tool for studying global change impacts on mountain hydrology. Regarding the simulation of the carbon cycle, this investigation detected some data and model limitations that are discussed in detail. Finally, suggestions for model improvements are made, mainly concerning the formulations of decomposition and respiration rates in biogeochemical models.},

@article{Manoli2014b,
abstract = {Competition for water among multiple tree rooting systems is investigated using a soil–plant model that accounts for soil moisture dynamics and root water uptake (RWU), whole plant transpiration, and leaf- level photosynthesis. The model is based on a numerical solution to the 3D Richards equation modified to account for a 3D RWU, trunk xylem, and stomatal conductances. The stomatal conductance is deter- mined by combining a conventional biochemical demand formulation for photosynthesis with an optimi- zation hypothesis that selects stomatal aperture so as to maximize carbon gain for a given water loss. Model results compare well with measurements of soil moisture throughout the rooting zone, of total sap flow in the trunk xylem, as well as of leaf water potential collected in a Loblolly pine forest. The model is then used to diagnose plant responses to water stress in the presence of competing rooting systems. Unsurprisingly, the overlap between rooting zones is shown to enhance soil drying. However, the 3D spa- tial model yielded transpiration-bulk root-zone soil moisture relations that do not deviate appreciably from their proto-typical form commonly assumed in lumped eco-hydrological models. The increased overlap among rooting systems primarily alters the timing at which the point of incipient soil moisture stress is reached by the entire soil–plant system.},
annote = {Objetivo:
Desarrollar un modelo mecan{\'{i}}stico en 3D de la absorci{\'{o}}n radicular de agua (RWU) con el que explorar la competencia entre ra{\'{i}}ces y sus implicaciones en la transpiraci{\'{o}}n y la asimilaci{\'{o}}n de carbono.
- Crear un modelo suelo-planta-atm{\'{o}}sfera que incorpore la din{\'{a}}mica del agua del suelo en 3D.
- Investigar c{\'{o}}mo afectan algunos factores bi{\'{o}}ticos y abi{\'{o}}ticos en el RWU y la eficiencia en el uso del agua (WUE).
- Evaluar los efectos de ra{\'{i}}ces arb{\'{o}}reas solapadas en el RWU.

Teor{\'{i}}as e hip{\'{o}}tesis:
Intercambios suelo-planta:
La humedad en el suelo se representa mediante la ecuaci{\'{o}}n de Richard en 3D. En esta ecuaci{\'{o}}n se incorpora un t{\'{e}}rmino fuente/sumidero ( q($\psi$,x,y,z,t,$\psi$L) ), el cual une la din{\'{a}}mica de la humedad del suelo ocn el sistema ra{\'{i}}z planta a trav{\'{e}}s del potencial en las hojas ($\psi$L).
Se define la transpiraci{\'{o}}n de una planta de dos formas: a partir de la conductancia del xylema y la diferencia de potencial entre las hojas y la base del xylema, y a partir de la conductancia de las ra{\'{i}}ces-suelo y la diferencia de potencial entre la base del xylema y el suelo. La igualdad de estas dos ecuaciones permite calcular el succi{\'{o}}n en la base del xylema.

Intecambios planta-atm{\'{o}}sfera:
El modelo discretiza una serie de capas verticales para simular la atenuaci{\'{o}}n de la luz.
Se define la fotos{\'{i}}ntesis o ganancia de carbono (fc) y el consumo de agua o transpiraci{\'{o}}n (fw) para cada capa r del follaje. La conductancia de los estomas, necesaria para fw, se calcula de manera que se optimice fc para un valor dado de fw y una eficacia en el uso del agua ($\lambda$); se incorpora un t{\'{e}}rmino para incluir la transpiraci{\'{o}}n nocturna.

Resoluci{\'{o}}n de la ecuaci{\'{o}}n
La transpiraci{\'{o}}n obtenida a partir del modelo suelo-planta se iguala con la calculada en el modelo planta-atm{\'{o}}sfera (integraci{\'{o}}n de fw para todas las capas r). De esta igualdad se obtiene una ecuaci{\'{o}}n no lineal que se resuelve por el m{\'{e}}todo de la secante en cada iteraci{\'{o}}n de Picard para calcular $\psi$L, el valor que enlaza los dos modelos previos.

Metodolog{\'{i}}a:
Se utilizan datos de dos a{\~{n}}os en un bosque de pinos de 100 ha en Carolina del norte.
1. Modelo 1D de un solo {\'{a}}rbol para calibrar el modelo por comparaci{\'{o}}n con las observaciones.
2. Modelo 3D con dos {\'{a}}rboles id{\'{e}}nticos para estudiar c{\'{o}}mo afecta la competencia entre ra{\'{i}}ces a la din{\'{a}}mica de la humedad del suelo y la fotos{\'{i}}ntesis. Se simula en un ciclo de secado de 100 d{\'{i}}as, y en un segundo experimento con lluvia constante.

Resultados:
Calibraci{\'{o}}n del modelo:
- El modelo reproduce los principales procesos de la din{\'{a}}mica del agua del suelo. Se observan dos discrepancias: al inicio del modelo y en cambios r{\'{a}}pidos de la humedad en las capas inferiores.
- El modelo captura el potencial de las hojas y la transpiraci{\'{o}}n.

Competencia entre {\'{a}}rboles:
- Se incrementa el RWU en las zonas de solape, desplaz{\'{a}}ndose a capas inferiores
- Se acelera la paraci{\'{o}}n de los mecanismos de compensaci{\'{o}}n: redistribuci{\'{o}}n hidr{\'{a}}ulica y flujos de Darcy. HR afecta a las capas superiores y DR a las inferiores, siendo este {\'{u}}ltimo el principal flujo de redistribuci{\'{o}}n.

Transpiraci{\'{o}}n y saturaci{\'{o}}n del suelo:
Se generan curvas RWU-humedad media del suelo (Sw) para dos escenarios (sin lluvia y lluvia constante) y se analiza c{\'{o}}mo afecta la distancia entre {\'{a}}rboles (D).
- Sin lluvia: RWU no depende de D y se reduce notablemente para humedades menores al 12{\%}. D afecta {\'{u}}nicamente en la velocidad con la que se llega a esa humedad. Una menor RWU supone una mejor WUE.
- Lluvia constante: se ralentiza la aparici´no del estr{\'{e}}s h{\'{i}}drico y el punto de cr{\'{i}}tico de la humedad se desplaza a valores inferiores. Las curvas RWU-Sw muestran cierta dependencia de D y del tipo de suelo.

Limitaciones:
- No hay almacenamiento de agua en las plantas.
- Se desprecian las p{\'{e}}rdidas de energ{\'{i}}a en el sistema radicular.
- El RWU no se limita por factores como la disponibilidad de nutrientes.
- Se ignora el crecimiento radicular (no es realista a largo plazo).
- No se simulan las estrategias de adaptaci{\'{o}}n de las plantas para distribuir sus ra{\'{i}}ces. Incorporar la din{\'{a}}mica de las ra{\'{i}}ces, mejorar{\'{i}}a el modelo.

Preguntas sin respuesta:


Futura investigaci{\'{o}}n:
- Entender c{\'{o}}mo la relaci{\'{o}}n saturaci{\'{o}}n del suelo-RWU var{\'{i}}a bajo diferents condiciones hidrol{\'{o}}gicas y localizaci{\'{o}}n de la biomasa de las ra{\'{i}}ces.},

abstract = {The problem of selecting the appropriate design flood is a constant concern to dam engineering and, in general, in the hydrological practice. Overtopping represents more than 40{\%} of dam failures in the world. The determination of the design flood is based in some cases on the T-year quantile of flood peak, and in other cases considering also the T-year quantile of flood volume. However, flood peak and flood volume have a positive (strong or weak) dependence. To model properly this aspect a bivariate probability distribution is considered using the concept of 2-Copulas, and a bivariate extreme value distribution with generalized extreme value marginals is proposed. The peak-volume pair can then be transformed into the correspondent flood hydrograph, representing the river basin response, through a simple linear model. The hydrological safety of dams is considered checking adequacy of dam spillway. The reservoir behavior is tested using a long synthetic series of flood hydrographs. An application to an existing dam is given.},
