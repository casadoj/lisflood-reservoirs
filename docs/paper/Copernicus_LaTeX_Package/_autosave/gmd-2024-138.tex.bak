 This work presents the land model ``Pochva''. ``Pochva'' is a
model of hydro-thermal processes at the Earth surface and in the underlying
medium. The model simulates the main hydro-thermal parameters of the
surface, soil layer, vegetation and snow cover. The soil process scheme
accounts for diversity in the vertical profile of the soil physical
parameters. The snow cover is processed in a multilayer scheme and its
numerical algorithm allows solutions for both extremely thin and extremely
thick layer cases. The model is characterized by a particular accuracy in
simulating the water phase transitions in soil and snow, and by the autonomy
in the determination of the lower boundary condition in the soil column. The
model can be used as a stand-alone land-surface model driven by observed or
analytical forcing data, or coupled to an atmospheric model, either global
or limited-area, either in forecast regime or climatic regime. The results
of coupling ``Pochva'' to the numerical weather prediction limited-area
model ``Bolam'' are presented.

\introduction

Water mass balance and energy balance at the Earth surface are key processes
in the numerical modelling of the atmosphere. Such surface processes affect
the conditions at the lower boundary for the main atmospheric parameters as
well as the air parameters in the surface layer. The surface hydro-thermal
conditions are simulated by a scheme (or model) of hydro-thermal processes
at the surface and inside the underlying media, composed by the soil layer,
possibly covered by vegetation, and by a snow layer.

The modelling of hydro-thermal processes in the underlying media evolved
significantly from a simple soil scheme e.g. (Deardorff, 1978) to complex
vegetation structures with multilayer soil hydrology and energy and
multilayer snow. Examples of currently used land surface schemes include the
Interaction Soil-Biosphere-Atmosphere model (ISBA), (Noilhan and Planton,
1989); the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS), (Verseghy, 1991; Verseghy
et al., 1993); the Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land model
(TESSEL), (Viterbo and Beljaars, 1995), including multilayer snow scheme
(Arduini et al., 2019), the NOAH model (Ek et al., 2003); the Common Land
Model of National Center of Atmospheric Research (USA) and Sun Yat-sen
University (China) (Dai et al., 2003); the Community Land Model (CLM),
(Oleson et al., 2010), Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES), (Best et
al., 2011), GEOtop (S. Endrizzi et al., 2014). Santanello et al.~(2018)
provided a thorough discussion of the processes occurring between the
atmosphere and the land surface and their important role in the numerical
modelling of the atmosphere.

The large number and variety of existing models reflect the particular focus
of the several different processes occurring for the soil and the
vegetation. Such differences are related to the different purposes of their
application: weather prediction, study of atmospheric processes, simulation
of snow cover and avalanche prediction, climate simulations coupled with
biosphere models. Some models pay particular attention to hydro-thermal
exchange processes in the soil, take into account phase transition processes
in soil water and processes in the snow layer and accurately describe the
fluxes at soil surface. These models are more suitable for application in
modelling of atmospheric processes and weather forecasting. Other models pay
more attention to an accurate description of the processes related to
vegetation, distinguishing high and low vegetation, simulating in detail
processes like evapotranspiration and providing an accurate simulation of
carbon cycle. These models are more suited to climate and Earth system
modelling.

The model proposed in the present work is closer to the first class of
models, i.e. is more suitable for models targeted at the study of
atmospheric process and weather prediction models. In the proposed model,
special attention is paid to the following aspects: the accuracy of
description of heat and moisture exchange in the soil including the water
phase transitions, the accuracy and reliability in the description of
processes in the snow cover (including water melting and re-freezing), the
inhomogeneity in soil parameters along the vertical, the definition of
thermal and hydraulic conductivity in the soil, the definition of the air
humidity at the contact surface with the soil and vegetation leaves, the
problem of determining the albedo and density of snow cover depending on its
previous state. In the proposed land model an original method is employed
for the definition of the bottom boundary conditions for temperature and
humidity, making the scheme autonomous within the context of a known
climatology or climatological drift. The model can also be useful for the
simulation of snow cover for avalanche prediction purposes since the snow
module is independent of the other modules and can be applied separately.
``Pochva'' can also be used with a forcing derived from observational data
for defining the fluxes between the surface and the atmosphere as well as
for idealised column simulations.

The present paper is divided into eight sections. Sections~2 to 6 describe
the numerical schemes included in the ``Pochva'', indeed surface processes,
processes in the vegetation, heat exchange processes in the soil, moisture
exchange processes in the soil, and processes in the snow layer. Section~7
and Appendix contain the description of the numerical experiments and their
results. Section~8 summarizes the conclusions and discusses some critical
points of the land model and some issues on the verification results.

\section{Surface processes scheme}

In the atmospheric numerical modelling the interaction between the
atmosphere and the Earth surface involves mainly fluxes of heat and
moisture. The thermal state of the soil environment in the present model is
synthesized by entropy, as it simplifies the description of the water phase
changes following the idea proposed in Pressman~(1994).

The state of the atmosphere in interaction with the Earth surface is
described by air temperature, specific humidity and pressure at the lowest
atmospheric level, turbulent transfer coefficients between surface and
lowest atmospheric level, total net radiation flux, fluxes of atmospheric
precipitation in liquid and crystal phases. The thermodynamic state of the
surface is described by two parameters, temperature and specific humidity of
the air at the surface. The values of these two parameters depend on the
whole state of the underlying surface.

\subsection{State of the soil surface}

According to the principles adopted in this work, a unit size of underlying
surface is composed by a set of fractional contributions each of which
exhibits uniform characteristics from the point of view of the interaction
with the atmosphere. The soil surface cover can be characterized by
vegetation (grass, shrub, trees, woodland) and snow. Snow cover and
vegetation imply the presence of a particular layer with its own
thermodynamic characteristics, thus with a distinct temperature. For this
reason, it is not possible to classify these surface categories as a
fraction of the surface of the soil itself, but it is necessary to consider
them as independent ``columns''. As a consequence, if we introduce the
concept of fraction of snow cover, it is necessary to divide the surface
into three independent columns, each having its own temperature even in case
of equal upper and lower boundary conditions. In the present version of the
land model, however, the following simplifying assumptions have been made:
the vegetation is not a special medium, but it is considered as a part of
the soil surface with particular characteristics; the snow layer can either
cover all the grid cell surface or not exist at all, a fractional snow cover
is introduced only as a diagnostic field to allow computation of the
radiative characteristics of the surface (albedo, emissivity). Under these
assumptions, the soil surface can either consist of bare soil possibly
partly covered by vegetation, which in turn may be partly covered by water
or snow. These two features of the surface are assumed as they cannot exist
simultaneously.

 %f1
Figure 1: Scheme of the soil surface.

For each area of a single model grid cell the vegetation fraction is
determined by an external vegetation parameter dataset. The fraction of
vegetation leaves covered by water is determined by the ratio between the
water mass deposited on the leaf surface and the maximum value of this mass,
which is also evaluated using a dataset.

Then the fractional surface interacting with atmosphere can be:
\begin{itemize}
\item without snow cover ($F_\mathrm{snow}=0$):
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] $F_\mathrm{baresoil}=1-F_\mathrm{veg}$ bare soil

\item[2.] $F_\mathrm{veg}^\mathrm{dry}=F_\mathrm{veg}\cdot \left( 1-F_\mathrm{veg}^\text{leaf wet}
\right)$ vegetation leaves not covered by water

\item[3.] $F_\mathrm{veg}^\mathrm{wet}=F_\mathrm{veg}\cdot F_\mathrm{veg}^\text{leaf wet}$ vegetation
leaves covered by water

in case of snow cover, under the indicated assumptions the only type of
interacting surface is:
\item[4.] $F_\mathrm{snow}=1$.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
More precisely, in presence of snow, we always assume $F_\mathrm{snow}=1$ for the
computation of moisture fluxes, while for the entropy fluxes,
$F_\mathrm{snow}=1$ holds only if the snow cover has a minimal thickness,
otherwise, for a thin snow layer, entropy fluxes are computed under the
assumption of $F_\mathrm{snow}=0$.

For each of these four surface types, surface air temperature and humidity
have to be defined. The overall surface air temperature and humidity for the
whole grid cell are then computed as a weighted average where each weight
equals the fractional area for each surface type.

\subsection{Air temperature and humidity on bare soil}

For bare soil, the surface air temperature ($T_\text{surf soil}$) is equal to
the temperature of the upper soil layer ($T_\text{soil 0}$). The air specific
humidity $q_\text{v  surf  soil}$\,kg\,kg$^{-1}$ is defined according to the
diagnostic expression
\begin{equation}
q_\text{v surf soil}=q_\text{v atm 1}\cdot\left( \mathrm{1-}\alpha_\mathrm{soil}
\right){+}q_\text{v sat}\left( T_\text{soil  0}
\right)\cdot\alpha_\mathrm{soil},
\end{equation}
where: $q_\text{v atm 1}$ is the air specific humidity at the lowest
atmospheric level (kg\,kg$^{-1}$), $q_\text{v sat}$ ($T_\text{soil 0}$) is the
saturation air specific humidity at temperature $T_\text{soil 0}$ computed as:
\begin{equation}
q_\text{v sat}=\left\{ {\begin{array}{l}
 q_\text{v sat}^\mathrm{water}\left( T_\text{soil 0} \right), \text{~if~} T_\text{soil 0} \geqslant T_{0} \\
 q_\text{v sat}^\text{ice}\left( T_\text{soil 0} \right)\text{~if~} T_\text{soil 0}<T_{0} \\
 \end{array}} \right.,
\end{equation}
where $q_\text{v sat water}$ and $q_\text{v sat ice}$ are saturation air
specific humidity over liquid water and ice respectively, $\alpha_\mathrm{soil}$
is an empirical coefficient, $\mathrm{To}   = 273.15$ (K) is constant.

For the definition of the empirical coefficient $\alpha_\mathrm{soil}$ an
original method is proposed in this work. The approach is based on Kondo
et al.~(1990) using both concepts of turbulent exchange and influence of top
soil moisture to surface air humidity. Various empirical parameters have
been introduced by the author and presented in formulae (3), (4), (5). These
formulations and the values of parameters are the results of many numerical
experiments and statistical verification on a big number of observational
meteorological stations (see Sect.~7). The definition is the following:
\begin{equation}
\alpha_\mathrm{soil}=\frac{{2\cdot
}F_{{2}}^\mathrm{soil}}{e^{F_{{1}}^\mathrm{soil}K_\mathrm{v}^\mathrm{turb}}
{+}e^{{-}F_{{1}}^\mathrm{soil}K_\mathrm{v}^\mathrm{turb}}},
\end{equation}
where:
$K_\mathrm{v}^\mathrm{turb}$ is the coefficient of water vapour turbulent exchange in
the lowest 1\,m of the surface layer (m$^{2}$\,s$^{-1}$),

$F_{1}^\mathrm{soil}$ and $F_{2}^\mathrm{soil}$ are empirical functions of the relative
moisture contents of the upper soil layer:
\begin{gather}
F_{{1}}^\mathrm{soil}{=7\cdot }\left[ {2+3\cdot }\left(
{1-}q_{{0}}^{rel} \right)^{{0.2+0.05\cdot }b} \right],
\\
F_{{2}}^\mathrm{soil}{=1-0.8\cdot }\left(
{1-}q_{{0}}^\mathrm{rel} \right)^{{0.2+0.05\cdot }b},
\end{gather}
where $b$ is the so-called ``soil exponent'' (Clapp and Hornberger, 1978),
$q_{0}^\mathrm{rel}$ is the soil relative water content at the top level (see
Sect.~4). The choice of the values defining the empirical function is
crucial since it strongly influences the magnitude of the water vapour flux
and its associated latent heat flux, which, in turn, influences the soil
surface temperature and the air temperature at 2\,m routinely used for the
verification of numerical weather predictions. The methodology used for the
definition of the empirical coefficients and their influence on the
numerical weather forecast will be treated in a separate publication
dedicated to the evaluation of the numerical model results.

\subsection{Air temperature and humidity over vegetation with leaves not covered by
water}

The air temperature in this case ($T_\mathrm{veg}^\mathrm{dry}$) is equal to the
temperature of the topmost soil layer ($T_\text{soil 0}$). For the definition
of air humidity two cases are distinguished: the evapotranspiration is
active or is not active. The conditions under which evapotranspiration is or
is not active are shown in Sect.~3.

The method of numerical approximation of evapotranspiration presented here
has been formulated using the approach presented in Pressman~(1994).

In the case of lack of evapotranspiration, the air humidity is equal to the
air humidity at the lowest atmospheric layer while in the case of active
evapotranspiration by leaves not covered by water it is defined analogously
to the case of bare soil:
\begin{equation}
q_\text{v veg}^\mathrm{dry}=\left\{ {\begin{array}{l}
 q_\text{v atm},\text{~if~evapotranspiration~not~active} \\
 q_\text{v atm}\cdot \left( 1-\alpha_\mathrm{veg}\cdot \beta_\mathrm{veg}
\right)+q_\text{v sat}\left( T_\text{soil 0} \right)\cdot \alpha
_\mathrm{veg}\cdot \beta_\mathrm{veg},\text{~if~evapotranspiration active} \\
 \end{array}} \right.,
\end{equation}
where:
$q_\text{v veg}^\mathrm{dry}$ is the air specific humidity over respiring plant
leaf,
$q_\text{v atm}$ is air specific humidity at the bottom atmospheric level (kg\,kg$^{-1}$),
$q_\text{v sat}(T_\text{soil 0}$) is saturation air specific humidity (kg\,kg$^{-1}$) at soil surface temperature $T_\text{soil 0}$, (see Sect.~2.2),
$\alpha_\mathrm{veg}$ is an empirical parameter depending on the magnitude of
the evapotranspiration activity,
$\beta_\mathrm{veg}$ is a parameter depending on the moisture content in the
root layer of the soil, the definition of this parameter is given by
Eqs.~(11)--(13) (see below).

The approximation of the parameter defining the evapotranspiration activity
is similar to the method presented by Eq.~(3). The parameter is given
by:
\begin{equation}
\alpha_\mathrm{veg}=\frac{2\cdot F_{2}^\mathr,{veg}}{e^{F_{1}^\mathrm{veg}\cdot
K_\mathrm{v}^\mathrm{turb}}+e^{-F_{1}^\mathrm{veg}\cdot K_\mathrm{v}^\mathrm{turb}}},
\end{equation}
where $F_{1}^\mathrm{veg}$ and $F_{2}^\mathrm{veg}$ are empirical functions depending on
the turbulent exchange coefficients for water vapour in the lowest 1\,m of
the atmospheric surface layer and on the intensity of the evapotranspiration
process which in turn depends on the flux of incoming visible solar
radiation and on LAI (Leaf Area Index) following the conception proposed in
(Viterbo et al., 1995) according to:
\begin{gather}
F_{1}^\mathrm{veg}=30\cdot \left[ -1.9\cdot \frac{\mathrm{LAI}}{\mathrm{LAI}_{\max}}+2 \right],
\\
F_{2}^\mathrm{veg}=\min\left[ \left[ \min\left( \frac{F_\text{rad vis}}{600},1
\right) \right]^{0.3}, \left( \frac{\mathrm{LAI}}{\mathrm{LAI}_{\max}}
\right)^{0.2} \right],
\end{gather}
where
$F_\text{rad vis}$ is the flux of visible solar radiation at the surface (W\,m$^{-2}$),
{LAI}$_{\max}$ is the maximum value of LAI in the static global database used.

In this case, as in the case of air surface humidity over bare soil, the
various empirical parameters in formulae (7), (8), (9) have been introduced
by the author and their values have been obtained as result of many
numerical experiments and statistical verification.

In order to evaluate the parameter $\beta_\mathrm{veg}$, a description of the
finite-difference representation of the vertical space coordinate used in
the model is described here.

As a vertical coordinate, the geometrical length (depth) is used, with the
origin positioned at the surface and values increasing with depth. The
vertical computational domain is divided into full and half levels, with the
upper full level having index zero, and with each half level having the same
index as the full level located below it; the level indexes increase with
depth (see Fig.~2).

%f2
Figure 2: Finite-difference discretisation of the vertical coordinate in the
soil.

The upper part of the soil column may contain plant roots. The depth of the
root layer is defined as:
\begin{equation}
Z_\mathrm{root}=\sum\nolimits_{k=0}^k_\mathrm{root} \left( z_\mathrm{kh+1}-z_\mathrm{kh} \right) ,
\end{equation}
Where $z$ ($m$) is the space coordinate in soil, $k$ is the index of full level in
the vertical discretization, $k_\mathrm{root}$ is the index of the deepest root zone
level. The root zone depth is defined using a suitable vegetation dataset.
In this work the distribution of vertical soil levels is not uniform, the
thickness of soil layers increases with depth according to an exponential
law, but it is possible to apply any other distribution. The depth of the
soil bottom in the present scheme may be different for water exchange
processes and for thermal exchange processes, depending on bottom boundary
conditions, and they may differ from one geographical location to another
according to the local geographical characteristics.
\begin{gather}
\beta_\mathrm{veg}=\frac{\sum\nolimits_{k=0}^k_\mathrm{root} \left( z_\mathrm{kh+1}-z_\mathrm{kh}
\right) \cdot F\left( q_{k}^\mathrm{rel} \right)}{Z_\mathrm{root}},
\\
F\left( q_{k}^\mathrm{rel} \right)=\left\{ {\begin{array}{l}
 ~1,\text{~if~}q_{k}^{rel}\geqslant q_{k}^\mathrm{rel ref} \\
 \frac{q_{k}^\mathrm{rel}-q_{k}^\mathrm{rel wilt}}{q_{k}^\mathrm{rel ref}-q_{k}^\mathrm{rel}}, if q_{k}^\mathrm{rel wilt}<q_{k}^{rel}<q_{k}^{rel ref} \\
 \mathrm{\, \, \, \, }0,\text{~if~} q_{k}^{rel}\leqslant q_{k}^\mathrm{rel wilt} \\
 \end{array}} \right.,
\\
q_{k}^\mathrm{rel}=\frac{q_{k}-q_{k}^{\min}}{q_{k}^{\max}-q_{k}^{\min}},
\quad
q_{k}^\text{rel wilt}=\frac{q_{k}^\mathrm{wilt}-q_{k}^{\min}}{q_{k}^{\max}-q_{k}^{\min}},
\quad
q_{k}^\text{rel ref}=\frac{q_{k}^\mathrm{ref}-q_{k}^{\min}}{q_{k}^{\max}-q_{k}^{\min}},
\end{gather}
where
$q_{k}$ and $q_{k}^\mathrm{rel}$ are the soil specific volumetric
(m$^{3}$\,m$^{-3}$) and relative (proportion) water content at level $k$,
$q_{k}^\mathrm{max}$ and $q_{k}^{\min}$ are the maximum and minimum soil
specific volumetric contents at level $k$ (m$^{3}$\,m$^{-3}$),
$q_{k}^\mathrm{wilt}$ and $q_{k}^\mathrm{rel}^\mathrm{wilt}$ are soil specific
volumetric (m$^{3}$\,m$^{-3}$) and relative (proportion) water contents at
level $k$ at wilting point, i.e. at the water content at which plant
evapotranspiration stops because of too dry soil,
$q_{k}^\mathrm{ref}$ and $q_{k}^\mathrm{rel}^\mathrm{ref}$ are soil specific
volumetric (m$^{3}$\,m$^{-3}$) and relative (proportion) water contents at
level $k$ at ``reference point'', i.e. at the water content level at which
plant evapotranspiration stops increasing because of highly wet soil.

\subsection{Air temperature and humidity over vegetation with leaves covered by
water}

The air temperature in this case ($T_\mathrm{veg}^\mathrm{wet}$) is equal to the
temperature of the topmost soil layer ($T_\text{soil 0}$). The air humidity is
equal to the saturation humidity at the given temperature:
\begin{equation}
q_\text{v veg}^\mathrm{wet}=q_\text{v sat}\left(
T_\text{soil  0} \right),
\end{equation}
where $q_\mathrm{v sat}(T_\text{soil 0}$) is the saturation air specific humidity
(kg\,kg$^{-1}$) at soil surface temperature $T_\text{soil 0}$ (see Sect.~2.2).

\subsection{Air temperature and humidity over snow cover}

The air temperature in this case ($T_\text{surf snow}$) is equal to the
temperature of the topmost snow layer ($T_\mathrm{snow}_{0}$). The air humidity is
equal to the saturation humidity at the given temperature:
\begin{equation}
q_\text{v surf snow}=q_\text{v sat}\left(
T_\text{snow 0} \right),
\end{equation}
where $q_\text{v sat}(T_\mathrm{snow 0}$) is the saturation air specific
humidity (kg\,kg$^{-1}$) at snow cover surface temperature
$T_\mathrm{snow 0}$.
\begin{equation}
q_\text{v sat}=\left\{ {\begin{array}{l}
 q_\text{v sat}^\mathrm{water}\left( T_\text{snow 0} \right), \text{~if~} T_\text{snow 0}\geqslant T_{0} \\
 q_\text{v sat}^{ice}\left( T_\text{snow 0} \right),\text{~if~}T_\mathrm{snow 0}<T_{0} \\
 \end{array}} \right.,
\end{equation}
where $q_\text{v sat}^\mathrm{water}$ and $q_\text{v sat}^\mathrm{ice}$ are saturation air
specific humidity (kg\,kg$^{-1}$) at snow cover surface temperature
$T_\text{snow 0}$ over liquid water and over ice respectively.

\subsection{Air temperature and humidity over a composite soil surface}

Having defined the values of air temperature and humidity over all the
possible components of a composite soil surface, and knowing the fraction of
each component of the surface, it is possible to define the overall surface
air temperature ($T_\mathrm{surf}$) and humidity ($q_\text{v surf}$).

In absence of snow cover, or in presence of a so-called shallow snow layer
(see the description of snow scheme) the overall surface air temperature is
equal to the weighted mean of the temperatures of the surface components:
\begin{equation}
T_\mathrm{surf}=T_\text{surf soil}\cdot F_\mathrm{baresoil}+T_\mathrm{veg}^\mathrm{dry}\cdot
F_\mathrm{veg}^\mathrm{dry}+T_\mathrm{veg}^\mathrm{wet}\cdot F_\mathrm{veg}^\mathrm{wet},
\end{equation}
while in case of a thick snow layer we have:
\begin{equation}
T_\mathrm{surf}=T_\text{surf snow}.
\end{equation}
Similar formulae hold for the surface specific humidity, in case of absence
of snow cover:
\begin{equation}
q_\text{v surf}=q_\text{v surf soil}\cdot
F_\mathrm{baresoil}+q_\text{v veg}^\mathrm{dry}\cdot F_\mathrm{veg}^\mathrm{dry}+q_\text{v veg}^\mathrm{wet}\cdot F_\mathrm{veg}^\mathrm{wet},
\end{equation}
and in presence of snow cover (either thick or shallow):
\begin{equation}
q_\text{v surf}=q_\text{v surf snow}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Entropy flux between soil surface and atmosphere}

The surface incoming entropy flux is composed by the turbulent flux of
entropy for dry air, the turbulent flux of entropy due to water vapour and
the entropy flux due to global radiation:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_\text{S surf}=\Phi_\text{S rad}+\Phi
_{\mathrm{S}_\mathrm{da}}^\mathrm{turb}+\Phi_{\mathrm{S}_\mathrm{v}}^\mathrm{turb},
\end{equation}
where:
$\Phi_\text{S surf}$ is the surface entropy flux (J\,K$^{-1}$\,m$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$),
$\Phi_\text{S da}^\mathrm{turb}$ and $\Phi_\text{S v}^\mathrm{turb}$ are the entropy
fluxes originating from turbulent entropy flux of dry air and of water
vapour (J\,K$^{-1}$\,m$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$),
$\Phi_\text{S rad}$ is the entropy flux originating from global radiation (J\,K$^{-1}$\,m$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$).

The flux of entropy due to the flux of water (in liquid and solid phases)
from atmospheric precipitation is neglected since in the soil entropy scheme
the entropy flux originating from soil moisture flux is also neglected.

The entropy fluxes are computed according to the following relations:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_\text{S rad}=\frac{\Phi_\mathrm{rad}}{T_\mathrm{surf}},
\end{equation}
where $\Phi_\mathrm{rad}$ is the flux of global radiation (W\,m$^{-2}$).
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{\mathrm{S}_\mathrm{da} \mathrm{surf}}^\mathrm{turb}=K_\mathrm{h}^\mathrm{turb}\cdot \rho_\text{a surf}\cdot \frac{S_\text{da surf}-S_\text{da atm}}{z_\mathrm{atm}} ,
\end{equation}
where:
$K_\mathrm{h}^\mathrm{turb}$ is the coefficient of heat exchange in the surface layer  (m$^{2}$\,s$^{-1}$),
$\rho_\text{a surf}$ is the air density at the surface (kg\,m$^{-3}$),
$z_\mathrm{atm}$ is the height of the lowest atmospheric level (m).
$S_\text{da surf}$ and $S_\text{da atm}$ are specific entropy of dry air on the
surface and at the lowest atmospheric level (J\,kg$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$).

The entropy of dry air is defined by the relation:
\begin{equation}
S_\mathrm{da}=q_\mathrm{d}\cdot \left[ C_{p}^\mathrm{d}\ln\left( \frac{T}{T_{0}}
\right)-R_\mathrm{d}\ln\left( \frac{P_\mathrm{d}}{P_{0}} \right) \right]:
\end{equation}
where:
$S_\mathrm{da}$ is the specific entropy of dry air (J\,kg$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$),
$q_\mathrm{d}$ is the specific mass of dry air (kg\,kg$^{-1}$),
$T$ is the temperature (K),
$P_\mathrm{d}$ is the partial pressure of dry air (Pa),
$T_{0}=273.15$\,K is the reference temperature,
$P_{0}=10^{5}$\,Pa is the reference pressure,
$C_{p}^\mathrm{d}=1004.6$\,J\,kg$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$ is the specific heat capacity of
dry air at constant pressure,
$R_\mathrm{d}=287.05$\,J\,kg$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$ is the gas constant of dry air.

In order to define the entropy of dry air at the surface and at the lowest
atmospheric level, the known values of air temperature, humidity and
pressure are used together with the relations:
\begin{gather}
q_\text{da surf}=1-q_\text{v surf},
\\
q_\text{da atm}=1-q_\text{v atm},
\\
P_\text{d surf}=P_\text{surf}-e_\text{surf},
\\
P_\text{d atm}=P_\text{atm}-e_\text{atm},
\end{gather}
$q_\text{da surf}$ and $q_\text{da atm}$ are dry air specific mass at the
surface and at the lowest atmospheric level (kg\,kg$^{-1}$),
$P_\text{d surf}$ and $P_\text{d atm}$ are partial pressure of dry air at the
surface and at the lowest atmospheric level (Pa),
$e_\text{surf}$ and $e_\text{atm}$ are partial pressure of water vapour at
the surface and at the lowest atmospheric level (Pa).

The entropy flux of water vapour originating from turbulent exchange in the
layer between soil surface and lowest atmospheric level is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{\text{S}_\text{v}}^\text{turb}=K_\mathrm{v}^\mathrm{turb}\cdot \rho_\text{a}\cdot \frac{S_\text{v surf}-S_\text{v atm}}{z_\text{atm}}\quad ,
\end{equation}
where $S_\text{v surf}$ and $S_\text{v atm}$ are specific entropy of water vapour at
the surface and at the lowest atmospheric level respectively (J\,kg$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$), which, in turn, are defined by:
\begin{equation}
S_\mathrm{v}=q_\mathrm{v}\cdot \left[ C_\mathrm{v}^{d}\ln\left( \frac{T}{T_{0}}
\right)-R_\mathrm{v}\ln\left( \frac{e}{e_{0}} \right)+\frac{L_{i}^\mathrm{v}}{T_{0}}
\right]
\end{equation}
where:
$S_\mathrm{v}$ is the specific entropy of water vapour(J\,kg$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$),
$q_\mathrm{v}$ is the air specific humidity (kg,\kg$^{-1}$),
$e$ is the partial pressure of water vapour (Pa),
$e_{0}=611$\,Pa is the reference partial pressure of water vapour,
$C_{p}^\mathrm{v}=1869.46$\,J\,kg$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$ is the specific heat of water
vapour at constant pressure,
$R_\mathrm{v}=461.51$\,J\,kg$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$ is the gas constant for water vapour,
$L_{i}^\mathrm{v}=2\,834\,170.5$\,J\,kg$^{-1}$ is the specific latent heat for
ice-vapour phase transition.

The total entropy flux between atmosphere and soil surface ($\Phi_\text{S surf}$) determined in this way has to be assigned to each component of the
complex soil surface in order to define the boundary condition for each type
of surface. As introduced in Sect.~2.1, the surface can either be composed
of soil partially covered by low vegetation, or by snow, which, in turn, may
be ``thick'' or ``shallow''. From the point of view of entropy (energy)
exchange, low vegetation behaves as a ``transparent'' layer, i.e. it does
not have an own temperature and it is part of the soil surface thus it does
not have its own entropy flux. Thus, two cases may occur.

The first case occurs when snow cover is absent or shallow. In this case all
the components of the flux fully impinge on the soil surface with low
vegetation and snow surface does not receive any flux:
\begin{align*}
\Phi_\text{S surf}^\mathrm{soil}=\Phi_\text{S surf},
\\
\Phi_\text{S surf}^\mathrm{snow}=0.
\end{align*}
The second case occurs when snow layer is present and thick. In this case
all the entropy flux impinges on the snow surface and the soil surface does
not receive any direct flux:
\begin{align*}
\Phi_\text{S surf}^\mathrm{soil}=0,\\
\Phi_\text{S surf}^\mathrm{snow}=\Phi_\text{S surf}.
\end{align*}

\subsection{Water vapour flux between soil and atmosphere}

The flux of water vapour originating by means of turbulent exchange between
surface and atmosphere is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_\mathrm{v}^\mathrm{turb}=K_\mathrm{v}^\mathrm{turb}\cdot \rho_\text{a surf}\cdot
\frac{q_\text{v surf}-q_\text{v atm}}{z_\mathrm{atm}}\quad ,
\end{equation}
where $\Phi_\mathrm{v}^\mathrm{turb}$ is the flux of water vapour in the
atmosphere surface layer (kg\,m$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$).

This summary flux has to be split between the components of the soil
surface.

In the absence of snow cover, the water vapour exchange takes place between
atmosphere and soil surface covered by (partly wet) vegetation. Two cases
can be distinguished: in the first case the flux is positive (i.e.
downwards) thus condensation (deposition) of water vapour on the surface
takes place; in the second case the flux is negative (i.e. upwards) thus
evaporation (sublimation) from the surface takes place.

When the flux is directed downwards, it partly impinges on the bare soil
surface and partly on the vegetation, where it contributes to the formation
of dew over the leaves up to a maximum pre-specified value of water content
as in the formulae:
\begin{gather}
\Phi_\text{v soil}^\mathrm{turb}=\Phi_\mathrm{v}^\mathrm{turb}\cdot \left( 1-F_\mathrm{veg}
\right),
\\
\Phi_\text{v veg dry}^\mathrm{turb}=0,
\\
\Phi_\text{v veg wet}^\mathrm{turb}=\min\left\{ \Phi
_\mathrm{v}^\mathrm{turb}\cdot F_\mathrm{veg}, \frac{q_\text{w veg}^{\max}-q_\text{w veg}}{\Delta t} \right\},
\end{gather}
where:
$\Phi_\text{v soil}^\mathrm{turb}$\blackbox{Please confirm change.} is the flux of water vapour in the
atmospheric surface layer towards bare soil (kg\,m$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$),
$\Phi_\text{v veg dry}^\mathrm{turb}$ and $\Phi_\text{v veg wet}^\mathrm{turb}$\blackbox{Please confirm changes.} are the fluxes of water vapour in the atmospheric
surface layer towards not moistened and moistened vegetation (kg\,m$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$),
$q_\text{w veg}$ and $q_\text{w veg}^\mathrm{max}$ are the water content of plant leaves
and its maximum value (kg\,m$^{-2}$) respectively,
$\Delta t$ is the model time step (s).

When the flux is directed upwards, it removes water partly from the bare
soil surface, partly from the soil through plant evapotranspiration and
partly through evaporation of water on the leaves. When conditions for
evapotranspiration are not met, the corresponding flux is zero (see
description of vegetation scheme), while evaporation from leaves obviously
occurs as long as there is water available on leaf surface, as in the
following formulae:
\begin{gather}
\Phi_\text{v veg dry}^\mathrm{turb}=\left\{ {\begin{array}{l}
 \Phi_\mathrm{v}^\mathrm{turb}\cdot F_\mathrm{veg}^\mathrm{dry}, \text{if evapotranspiration possible} \\
 0, \text{if evapotranspiration not possible} \\
 \end{array}} \right.,
\\
\Phi_\text{v veg wet}^\mathrm{turb}=\max\left\{ \Phi
_\mathrm{v}^\mathrm{turb}\cdot F_\mathrm{veg}^\mathrm{wet}, \frac{-q_\text{w veg}}{\Delta t} \right\},
\\
\Phi_\text{v soil}^\mathrm{turb}=\Phi_\mathrm{v}^\mathrm{turb}-\Phi_\text{v veg dry}^\mathrm{turb}-\Phi_\text{v veg wet}^\mathrm{turb}.
\end{gather}
In the presence of snow cover, the water vapour fluxes between atmosphere
and bare soil/vegetation are null and the interaction takes place only
between atmosphere and snow layer:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_\text{v snow}^\mathrm{turb}=\Phi_\mathrm{v}^\mathrm{turb},
\end{equation}
where $\Phi_\text{v snow}^\mathrm{turb}$\blackbox{Please confirm change.} is the flux of water vapour in
the atmosphere surface layer towards the snow layer (kg\,m$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$).

\subsection{Atmospheric precipitation flux at the surface}

Atmospheric precipitation flux over surface, divided into liquid ($\Phi
_\mathrm{w}^\mathrm{liq}$) and solid ($\Phi_\mathrm{w}^\mathrm{ice}$), is provided by the
atmospheric model. The distribution of these fluxes over the soil surface
depends on the presence of snow over it.

In absence of snow cover, liquid precipitation contributes to the surface
components, including leaves, according to the fraction of each component;
the amount of water on leaves exceeding the maximum allowable is immediately
redistributed among the bare soil components:
\begin{gather}
\Phi_\text{w veg}^\mathrm{liq}=\min\left\{ \Phi_\mathrm{w}^\mathrm{liq}\cdot
F_\mathrm{veg}, \frac{q_\text{w veg}^{\max}-q_\text{w veg}}{\Delta t} \right\},
\\
\Phi_\text{w soil}^\mathrm{liq}=\Phi_\mathrm{w}^\text{liq}-\Phi_\text{w veg}^\mathrm{liq},
\\
\Phi_\text{w snow}^\mathrm{liq}=0,
\end{gather}
where $\Phi_\mathrm{w}^\mathrm{liq}$, $\Phi_\text{w soil}^\mathrm{liq}$, $\Phi
_\text{w veg}^\mathrm{liq}$, $\Phi_\text{w snow}^\mathrm{liq}$\blackbox{Please confirm changes.} are the fluxes of
atmospheric precipitation in liquid phase on the whole surface, on the soil
surface, on vegetation and on the snow-covered surface respectively (kg\,m$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$).

In presence of snow cover, all the liquid precipitation flux is directed
towards the snow layer:
\begin{gather}
\Phi_\text{w soil}^\mathrm{liq}=\Phi_\text{w veg}^\mathrm{liq}=0,
\\
\Phi_\text{w snow}^\mathrm{liq}=\Phi_\mathrm{w}^\mathrm{liq}.
\end{gather}
Conversely, solid precipitation flux is always directed towards snow layer,
creating it if it does not exist:
\begin{gather}
\Phi_\text{w snow}^\mathrm{ice}=\Phi_\mathrm{w}^\mathrm{ice},
\\
\Phi_\text{w soil}^\mathrm{ice}=\Phi_\text{w veg}^\mathrm{ice}=0.
\end{gather}
where $\Phi_\mathrm{w}^\mathrm{ice}$, $\Phi_\text{w snow}^\mathrm{ice}$, $\Phi
_\text{w soil}^\mathrm{ice}$, $\Phi_\text{w veg}^\mathrm{ice}$ are the fluxes of
atmospheric precipitation in solid phase on the whole surface, on the
snow-covered surface, on the snow-free soil surface and on vegetation
respectively (kg\,m$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$).

The surface processes scheme defines the conditions on the upper layer of
the soil column in absence of snow cover or on the snow column in presence
of snow. The boundary conditions are given by fluxes of entropy and water
which can comprise water vapour and precipitation. The soil scheme can also
define the air temperature and humidity over a composite surface.

\section{Scheme of vegetation processes}

In the vegetation scheme two processes are represented: evapotranspiration
and interception of water by plant leaves.

Considering evapotranspiration process, we recall that in the previous
section the water vapour flux between the soil surface and the lowest
atmospheric model was defined taking into account evapotranspiration of
plants ($\Phi_\text{v veg\, dry}^\mathrm{turb}$\blackbox{Please confirm change.}, 33, 35). In this section the
conditions under which evapotranspiration can take place are defined, as
well as the change in soil wetness due to evapotranspiration.

Evapotranspiration is possible when the following conditions are fulfilled:
\begin{enumerate}
\item in each level of the plant root zone the temperature is above 0\,{\degree}C;

\item the air saturation specific humidity at surface temperature is higher than
the actual air specific humidity at the lowest atmospheric layer, i.e. the
water vapour flux can be directed upwards;

\item leaves are present, i.e. Leaf Area Index (LAI) is nonzero;

\item photosynthesis is possible, i.e. the incoming visible radiation flux is
positive.
\end{enumerate}
The water vapor flux due to evapotranspiration from leaf surface not covered
by water ($\Phi_\text{v veg dry}^\mathrm{turb}$, see Sect.~2.7)
removes water from the root zone of the soil and each layer of this zone
loses water proportionally to its contribution to evapotranspiration flux.
In Sect.~2.3 it was shown how to determine air humidity over a
vegetation surface not covered by water depending on the evapotranspiration
rate (Eq.~6) and the scheme of vertical space discretization in soil was
presented (Fig.~2).

Consequently, the contribution of each root-zone level to the overall water
flux due to evapotranspiration becomes:
\begin{equation}
F_{k}=\frac{\left( z_{kh+1}-z_{kh} \right)\cdot F\left( q_{k}^\mathrm{rel}
\right)}{Z_\mathrm{root}}
\end{equation}
and the wetness variation in each soil level due to evapotranspiration is:
\begin{equation}
q_{k}^{\Delta t}=q_{k}^{0}+\Phi_\text{v veg dry}^\mathrm{turb}\cdot F_{k}\cdot \frac{\Delta t}{\rho_\mathrm{w}\cdot \left(
z_{kh+1}-z_{kh} \right)},
\end{equation}
where $\rho_\mathrm{w}$ is the liquid water density (kg\,m$^{-3}$).

When considering interception by vegetation leaves, the water content over
low-vegetation leaves is determined by the turbulent flux of water vapour
between the leaves and the lowest atmospheric level ($\Phi_\text{v  veg wet}^\mathrm{turb}$), which can lead either to evaporation
(sublimation) or to condensation (deposition), as well as by atmospheric
liquid precipitation flux over vegetation surface ($\Phi
_\text{w veg}^\mathrm{liq}$). Thus the prognostic equation for the water
deposited over leaves looks like:
\begin{equation}
q_\text{w veg}^{\Delta t}=\max\left\{ \min\left[ q_\text{w veg}^{0}+\left( \Phi_\text{v veg wet}^\mathrm{turb}+\Phi
_\text{w veg}^\mathrm{liq} \right)\cdot \Delta t, q_\text{w veg}^{\max} \right], 0 \right\},
\end{equation}
where $q^{\Delta t}_\text{w veg}$ and $q^{0}_\text{w veg}$
are the water content on plant leaves at the beginning and at the end of the
time step (kg\,m$^{-2}$), while the other variables were defined at
Sect.~2.7 and 2.8.

The water intercepted by vegetation leaves can cover the leaves either
partially or completely, as mentioned in Sect.~2.1, where the concept of
leaf fraction covered by water ($F_\mathrm{veg}^\text{leaf wet}$) was introduced.
This fraction is determined by the diagnostic relation:
\begin{equation}
F_\text{leaf wet}^\mathrm{veg}=\left( \frac{q_\text{w veg}}{q_\text{w veg}^{\max}} \right)^{2/ 3},
\end{equation}
where the exponent $2/3$ is needed to obtain the cross-section ratio from the
volume ratio for a spherical drop.

The vegetation scheme thus defines the variation of water content in the
root zone due to evapotranspiration and to water intercepted by leaves and
provides a diagnostic relation for the leaf fraction covered by water.

\section{Scheme of water exchange processes in the soil}

The main equation describing dynamics of liquid water along the soil profile
is the Darcy's law:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_\mathrm{f}=\frac{-\Omega }{\mu }\nabla P,
\end{equation}
where $\Phi_\mathrm{f}$ is the fluid flux (m\,s$^{-1}$), $\nabla P$ is
the pressure gradient (Pa\,m$^{-1}$), $\mu $ is the fluid viscosity (Pa\,s),
$\Omega $ is the section area (m$^{2}$). When applied to the transport of
water in soil, Darcy's law takes the form:
\begin{equation}
W_\mathrm{s}\frac{\partial \Psi }{\partial t}={K}\nabla^{2}\Psi -G,
\end{equation}
where $\Psi $ is the hydraulic head or hydraulic potential (m), $W_\mathrm{s}$ is
the ratio of drained water volume at saturation to the total material volume
(m$^{3}$\,m$^{-3}$) or maximum specific volumetric water content, ${K}$ is
the hydraulic conductivity (m\,s$^{-1}$), $G$ represents the water source terms
(m$^{3}$\,m$^{-3}$\,s$^{-1}$), $t$ is time (s).

Assuming the absence of water sources, in the hypothesis of constant ${K}$ and considering only the vertical coordinate, the equation can be
written as:
\begin{equation}
W_\mathrm{s}\frac{\partial \Psi }{\partial t}={K}\frac{\partial
^{\mathrm{2}}\Psi }{\partial z^{{2}}}.
\end{equation}
In the usual ``soil notation'' this equation is written as:
\begin{equation}
q_{\max}\frac{\partial \Psi }{\partial t}=\frac{\partial \left( \frac{\Phi
_\mathrm{w}}{\rho_\mathrm{w}} \right)}{\partial z},
\end{equation}
where $\frac{\Phi_\mathrm{w}}{\rho_\mathrm{w}}={K}\frac{\partial \Psi }{\partialz}$, $\Phi_\mathrm{w}$ is the soil water flux (kg\,m$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$), $q_{\max}$ is the maximum specific volumetric water content
(m$^{3}$\,m$^{-3}$), i.e. in the case when all the soil pores are filled with
water; this parameter depends on the soil texture and changes along the
profile depending on soil horizon.

The equation introduced here operates on soil hydraulic potential, while the
main prognostic quantity for soil moisture is $q$, i.e. the specific volumetric
moisture content (m$^{3}$\,m$^{-3}$), so it is necessary to express $\Psi $ in
terms of $q$.

Using the method of Clapp and Hornberger~(1978) and introducing the concept
of partially frozen soil moisture, the hydraulic potential can be
represented as:
\begin{equation}
\Psi =\Psi_{g}\left( \frac{q_{\max}}{q\left( 1-f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{soil} \right)}
\right)^{b},
\end{equation}
where $\Psi_{g}$ is the hydraulic potential of saturated soil (i.e.
when $q=q_\mathrm{max}$), $b$ is an empirical parameter named ``soil exponent'', both
these parameters depend on soil texture and can change along the soil
profile depending on soil horizon, $f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{soil}$ is the fraction of
frozen water with respect to total soil water. It can be noticed that
formula (54) is valid only when $f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{soil} < 1$ since in the
event of total freezing of water in the soil, the hydraulic potential tends
to infinity and no moisture motion can take place.

An important component of Eq.~(53) is the hydraulic conductivity of soil, which
depends on its physical properties and on soil water content itself. Using
again the Clapp and Hornberger~(1978) method and extending it to the case
of partly frozen soil moisture, the dependence of hydraulic conductivity on
water content takes the form:
\begin{equation}
K=K_{g}\left( \frac{q-f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{soil}q}{q_{\max}-f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{soil}q}
\right)^{2b+3},
\end{equation}
where $K_{g}$ is the hydraulic conductivity of saturated soil (when
$q=q_{\max}$), also depending on soil texture.

By substituting Eq.~(54) into Eq.~(53) under the assumption that
the fraction of frozen water does not change during the process, i.e.
${\partial f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{soil}} / {\partial
t}=0$, a prognostic equation for $q$ is obtained, describing the motion of
moisture along the soil profile:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial q}{\partial t}=\frac{\frac{\partial \left( \frac{\Phi
_\mathrm{w}}{\rho_\mathrm{w}} \right)}{\partial z}}{-\frac{q_{\max}}{q}\cdot \Psi
_{g}\cdot b\cdot \left( \frac{q_{\max}}{q\left( 1-f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{soil} \right)}
\right)^{b}}.
\end{equation}
In a finite difference representation, (see Fig.~2), applying an explicit
approximation of the moisture flux terms and of the space derivatives,
Eq.~(56) takes the form:
\begin{gather}
\frac{q_{k}^{\Delta t}-q_{k}^{0}}{\Delta t}=\frac{\frac{\Phi_{\mathrm{w}~kh+1}^{0}}{\rho_\mathrm{w}}-\frac{\Phi_{\mathrm{w} kh}^{0}}{\rho
_\mathrm{w}}}{z_{kh+1}-z_{kh}}\cdot \frac{1}{-\left( \frac{q_{\max}}{q_{k}^{0}}
\right)\cdot \Psi_{g}\cdot b\cdot \left( \frac{q_{\max}}{q_{k}^{0}\left(
1-f_{\mathrm{ice}~k}^{soil 0} \right)} \right)^{b}},
\\
\frac{\Phi_{\mathrm{w}~kh}^{0}}{\rho_\mathrm{w}}=K_{kh}\cdot \frac{\Psi
_{k}^{0}-\Psi^{0}_{k-1}}{z_{k}-z_{k-1}},
\end{gather}
where the upper indexes 0 and $\Delta t$ indicate the variables at the
beginning and at the end of the time step respectively, while the lower
indexes $k$ and $kh$ indicate the values of variables taken at full and half
vertical levels respectively (Fig.~2).

The values of the variables at half levels are computed as arithmetical
means $x_{kh}=$1/2($x_{k}_{-1}+x_{k}$).

In the case when a soil layer is completely frozen,
$f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{soil}=1$, the hydraulic potential tends to infinity, so the
moisture flux is simply set to 0, i.e. if $f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{soil}=1$ or
$f_{\mathrm{ice}~k}_{-1}=1$, then $\Phi^{0}_{\mathrm{w}~kh}=0$.

\section{Scheme of thermal exchange processes in the soil}

As stated in Sect.~2, the quantity chosen to describe the thermal state of
the environment in the present model is entropy. The use of this quantity
allows to describe the phase changes of water in soil in a simple
mathematical form, while it does not differ significantly from other
thermodynamic quantities in the description of thermal exchange. In the
present model two main approximations are applied in the numerical solution
scheme. The first is the application of the splitting method for solving the
prognostic equation for entropy, i.e. the equation for the conductive
transport of entropy is solved separately from the equation of the
conservation of entropy in moist soil in case of phase change of soil water.
The second approximation consists in neglecting the entropy due to water
fluxes in the equation for the conductive transport of entropy. These
approximations are applied on the basis of the experience in the numerical
solution of the given problem. Due to the application of different space and
time approximations, problems generated by small numerical inaccuracies
(differences of big numbers) appeared, leading to an unacceptable
instability and unphysical solution in particular situations. The
aforementioned approximations mitigated these instabilities.

Starting from the first part of the problem, i.e. the conductive transport
of entropy in wet soil, this process is described by the diffusion equation
in the form:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial S_\mathrm{soil}}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial \Phi_{S~\mathrm{soil}}}{\partial z},
\end{equation}
where $S_\mathrm{soil}$ is the soil entropy (J\,K$^{-1}$\,m$^{-3}$), $\Phi_{S~\mathrm{soil}}$ is the soil entropy flux (J\,K$^{-1}$\,m$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$).

The entropy of wet soil is a function of the specific entropy:
\begin{gather}
S_\mathrm{soil}=\rho_\mathrm{soil}S_\mathrm{soil}^\mathrm{spec},
\\
S_\mathrm{soil}^\mathrm{spec}=C_\mathrm{soil}\ln\left( \frac{T}{T_{0}} \right),
\end{gather}
where $S_\mathrm{soil}^\mathrm{spec}$ is the specific entropy of wet soil (J\,kg$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$), $\rho_\mathrm{soil}$ is the density of wet soil (kg\,m$^{-3}$),
$C_\mathrm{soil}$ is the specific heat capacity of wet soil (J\,kg$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$),
$T$ is the soil temperature (K).

The conductive flux of entropy is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{S~\mathrm{soil}}=\frac{\lambda_\mathrm{soil}}{C_\mathrm{soil}}\frac{\partial
S_\mathrm{soil}^\mathrm{spec}}{\partial z},
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_\mathrm{soil}$ is the heat conductivity of wet soil (J\,s$^{-1}$\,m$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$).

From the thermodynamical point of view, wet soil includes two components:
dry soil, which does not undergo phase changes, and water, which undergoes
phase changes and can be represented as a mixture of water and ice (the
gaseous phase of water in soil is neglected). For this reason, the following
assumptions are made in relation to the parameters of wet soil:
\begin{gather}
\rho_\mathrm{soil}=\rho_\mathrm{soil}^\mathrm{dry}+q\left( \left( 1-f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{soil} \right)\rho
_\mathrm{w}+f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{soil}\rho_\mathrm{i} \right),
\\
C_\mathrm{soil}=C_\mathrm{soil}^\mathrm{dry}+q\left( \left( 1-f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{soil}
\right)C_\mathrm{w}+f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{soil}C_\mathrm{i} \right),
\end{gather}
where $\rho_\mathrm{soil}^\mathrm{dry}$ is the density of dry soil (kg\,m$^{-3}$),
$C_\mathrm{soil}^\mathrm{dry}$ is the specific heat capacity of dry soil (J\,kg$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$), both quantities depending on the soil characteristics (texture)
and varying along the vertical, $\rho_\mathrm{w}$ and $\rho_\mathrm{i}$ are
density of liquid water (1000\,kg\,m$^{-3}$) and ice (900\,kg\,m$^{-3}$),
$C_\mathrm{w}$ and $C_\mathrm{i}$ are specific heat capacity of liquid water (4186.8\,J\,kg$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$) and ice (2093.4\,J\,kg$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$), $q$ is the soil
specific volumetric water content (m$^{3}$\,m$^{-3}$) and
$f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{soil}$ is the fraction of frozen water in total soil water,
introduced in previous chapters.

Defining the value of the specific heat conductivity of moist soil is by
itself a non-obvious problem. The main factor influencing this quantity is
the moisture content of the soil. Different approaches for defining soil
heat conductivity depending on its moisture content are known in literature,
for example through hydraulic potential (Pielke, 2013) or through relative
water content and heat conductivity of dry and saturated soil (Peters-Lidard
et al., 1998; Best at al., 2011). In the present work a different approach
is proposed i.e. by means of relative water content and soil density:
\begin{equation}
\lambda_\mathrm{soil}=\min \left\{ \min \left[ \frac{\rho
_\mathrm{soil}^\mathrm{dry}}{1000}\cdot \sqrt q^\mathrm{rel} +0.3\cdot \frac{\rho
_\mathrm{soil}^\mathrm{dry}}{1000}, 3.0 \right]+q\cdot f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{soil}\cdot
\lambda_\mathrm{i}, 3.0 \right\},
\end{equation}
where $q^\mathrm{rel}$ is the soil relative water content, as in Eq.~(13) and $\lambda_\mathrm{i}$ is the heat conductivity of ice (2.0\,J\,s$^{-1}$\,m$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$).

The proposed definition and the proposed values for the coefficients were
formulated during the numerical experiments and verification of air
temperature shown in Sect.~9. The definition of this quantity
significantly influences near-surface temperatures, especially daily minimum
and maximum values and amplitude of diurnal cycle, in the cases of stable
boundary layer. The experiments have shown that the given formula is
suitable for different types of soil encountered in the territories of
Europe and Western Asia.

Considering now the second part of the problem, i.e. the conservation of
entropy of soil moisture in case of phase change, the quantity which has to
be conserved is the sum of liquid water and ice entropy:
\begin{equation}
S_\mathrm{soil}^\mathrm{water}=\rho_\mathrm{w}q\left( 1-f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{soil} \right)\left(
C_\mathrm{w}\ln\frac{T}{T_{0}}+\frac{L_\mathrm{i}^\mathrm{w}}{T_{0}} \right)+\rho
_{i}qf_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{soil}C_\mathrm{i}ln\frac{T}{T_{0}},
\end{equation}
where $S_\mathrm{soil}^\mathrm{water}$ is the entropy of soil water (J\,K$^{-1}$\,m$^{-3}$), $L_\mathrm{i}^\mathrm{w}$ is the specific latent heat of ice-water phase
change (333\,560.5\,J\,kg$^{-1}$).

The solution of the basic prognostic soil entropy Eq.~(59) is split
into two steps: the conductive transport of the entropy (Eq.~69 see below)
and the phase change of the soil water. In the approximation of the
conductive entropy transport the water phase changes are not considered,
i.e. the fraction of ice in total soil water ($f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{soil}$) is assumed
to be known and the only unknown is the temperature. In the equation
describing the phase changes of soil water (Eq.~66) two unknowns are present,
temperature and fraction of ice in soil water, so that, in order to solve
this equation an additional equation relating the two quantities has to be
added. This equation is introduced on the basis of the hypotheses that at
temperatures over 0\,{\degree}C the fraction of ice is equal to
zero, while at temperatures below a certain threshold (here $-$30\,{\degree}C is assumed) the water in liquid phase cannot exist
thus the fraction is equal to one. Between these two threshold values the
fraction of ice grows monotonically with decreasing temperature and the
shape of the growth is assumed to be a hyperbolic tangent:
\begin{equation}
f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{soil}=-\mathrm{tanh}\left[ \left( T-T_{0} \right)\cdot a\cdot f_{b}
\right],
\end{equation}
where the empirical coefficient $a=\frac{-4}{-30}$ defines the thermodynamic
regime and does not depend on the soil characteristics, while the
coefficient $f_{b}$ depends on the soil characteristics and can assume values
in the interval $1 \le  f_{b}  \le  2$:
\begin{equation}
f_{b}=2-\left\{ \frac{\min\left[ \max\left( b, 4
\right), 12 \right]-4}{8} \right\},
\end{equation}
where $b$ is the soil exponent already introduced in previous sections (about
water exchange processes), the higher the value of $b$, the smoother the growth
of the ice fraction with decreasing temperature.

The numerical solution of the split problem is now considered: the
discretisation of the vertical coordinate is the one shown in Sect.~2
(Fig.~2), while a time-explicit approximation of fluxes and of their
derivatives, is used; the equation for conductive transport of entropy (Eq.~59)
thus becomes, in finite-difference form:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\rho_\mathrm{soil}^{k}C_\mathrm{soil}^{k}ln\frac{T_{k}^{{\ast
}}}{T_{0}}-\rho_\mathrm{soil}^{k}C_\mathrm{soil}^{k}\ln\frac{T_{k}^{0}}{T_{0}}}{\Delta
t}=\frac{\frac{\lambda
_\mathrm{soil}^{kh+1}}{C_\mathrm{soil}^{kh+1}}\frac{C_\mathrm{soil}^{k+1}ln\frac{T_{k+1}^{0}}{T_{0}}-C_\mathrm{soil}^{k}ln\frac{T_{k}^{0}}{T_{0}}}{z_{k+1}-z_{k}}-\frac{\lambda
_\mathrm{soil}^{kh}}{C_\mathrm{soil}^{kh}}\frac{C_\mathrm{soil}^{k}\ln\frac{T_{k}^{0}}{T_{0}}-C_\mathrm{soil}^{k-1}ln\frac{T_{k-1}^{0}}{T_{0}}}{z_{k}-z_{k-1}}}{z_{kh+1}-z_{kh}},
\end{equation}
where indices $k$ and ${kh}$ indicate values on vertical full and half levels
respectively, the upper indices $^{o}$ and $^{\ast }$ indicate values of
temperature before and after the solution of the conductive transport
equation respectively. The values of the physical parameters on half levels
are computed as the arithmetic mean of the values on the full levels. In
order to compute the density and the heat capacity of wet soil, the value of
soil ice fraction computed at the beginning of the step is used.

The solution of Eq.~(69) allows to compute the temperature $T^*$ taking into
account the contribution of conductive heat flux but without taking into
account any possible phase change.

After solving the first part of the split problem, the obtained value of
temperature $T^*$ allows to compute the entropy of soil water, which is being
considered as its final value at the end of the time step:
\begin{equation}
S_{\mathrm{soil}~k}^{\Delta t}=\left\{ \rho_\mathrm{w}q_{k}\left(
1-f_{\mathrm{ice}~k}^{soil 0} \right)\left(
C_\mathrm{w}ln\frac{T_{k}^{\mathrm{\ast }}}{T_{0}}+\frac{L_\mathrm{i}^\mathrm{w}}{T_{0}}
\right)+\rho_\mathrm{i}q_{k}f_{\mathrm{ice}~k}^\mathrm{soil 0}C_\mathrm{i}\ln\frac{T_{k}^{\ast}}{T_{0}} \right\}\cdot \left(
z_{kh+1}-z_{kh} \right),
\end{equation}
where $q_{k}$ and $f_{\mathrm{ice}~ k}^\mathrm{soil 0}$ are the total moisture
content and soil ice fraction on the level $k$, before taking into account the
phase changes.

The value of soil water entropy obtained is then used for computing the
temperature and ice fraction at the end of the time step, i.e. after
considering the possible phase changes, by solving the equation system:
\begin{equation}
\left\{ {\begin{array}{l}
 \left[ \rho_\mathrm{w}q_{k}\left( 1-f_{\mathrm{ice}~k}^{\mathrm{soil} \Delta
t}\left( T_{k}^{\Delta t} \right) \right)\left( C_\mathrm{w}\ln\frac{T_{k}^{\Delta
t}}{T_{0}}+\frac{L_\mathrm{i}^\mathrm{w}}{T_{0}} \right)+\rho_\mathrm{i}q_{k}f_{\mathrm{ice}~k}^{soil \Delta t}\left( T_{k}^{\Delta t}
\right)C_\mathrm{i}ln\frac{T_{k}^{\Delta t}}{T_{0}} \right]\cdot \left(
z_{kh+1}-z_{kh} \right)=S_{\mathrm{soil}~k}^{\Delta t} \\
 f_\mathrm{ice}^{\mathrm{soil} \Delta t}=-\mathrm{tanh}\left[ \left(
T_{k}^{\Delta t}-T_{0} \right)\cdot a\cdot f_{b} \right] \\
 \end{array}} \right.,
\end{equation}
where $T_{k}^{\Delta t}$ and $f_{\mathrm{ice} k}^{\mathrm{soil} \Delta t}$ are the
values of temperature and ice fraction on level $k$ at the end of the time
step. The system (71) is solved by successive iterations, which is an
effective method in this case since functions (66) and (68) are smooth and
monotonous.

It should be noted that, in the presence of a thin layer of snow above the
soil surface, for which it is not advantageous, from the point of view of
numerical precision, to solve a separate equation for conductive transport
and phase change, the entropy of soil moisture on the upper soil layer is
increased by the value of the entropy of the thin snow layer (see next
section for more details). The resulting temperature value is valid both for
the soil surface and for the snow layer.

\section{Snow scheme}

The processes of formation, transformation and melting of snow above the
soil surface are very important as they are associated with water phase
changes, i.e. with a powerful energy source or sink, and with an important
thermal insolating layer between atmosphere and soil. In this work an
original multilayer scheme for the evolution of snow cover is proposed.

As it was shown in Sect.~2, from the point of view of thermodynamic
processes, the snow layer may either cover the entire surface or be
completely absent. However, a concept of minimal snow thickness is
introduced, above which the snow can be considered as a separate layer in
terms of heat transport and phase changes. If the snow layer thickness is
smaller than this minimum value, the snow is considered as an additional
component of the soil surface (Sect.~5). At the same time, when
considering water balance, i.e. processes related to atmospheric
precipitation and water vapour condensation and sublimation, the snow layer
thickness can be arbitrarily small, i.e. there is no minimum layer
thickness.

The snow layer can be approximated as a porous ice mass which can contain
water in the liquid phase, formed either by melting of the mass itself or
because of liquid precipitation incoming. This liquid water, as soon as it
appears, flows in the deepest layers of snow or in the soil. On the snow
surface, sublimation from the solid ice phase takes place.

The proposed model uses the snow mass per unit area (kg\,m$^{-2}$) as a
vertical coordinate in the snow layer instead of the more common geometric
length, so the term ``layer thickness'' here refers to the amount of snow
mass associated with a layer rather than its geometrical thickness. The
vertical discretisation includes full and half levels, the topmost full
level has index zero, the level index increases with depth and each half
level is situated above the full level with the same index (Fig.~3). With
the use of this vertical coordinate each layer, except the topmost one, has
the same, constant standard thickness. An increase or decrease of total snow
mass first changes the thickness of the top layer. If this thickness reaches
or exceeds the standard thickness or becomes smaller than a minimum value, a
layer is added or removed respectively. In these cases the values of snow
temperature and melted water content are recomputed considering the newly
appeared or disappeared level so that, throughout the snow column, the total
snow entropy, the liquid water content and other diagnostic characteristics
such as snow age and density are preserved. However, the amount of vertical
snow levels cannot exceed a given value. When the snow cover thickness is
such that this amount of vertical levels is not enough, the standard layer
thickness is increased (doubled) for that point and all the prognostic and
diagnostic quantities are recomputed on the new set of levels with
conservation of the vertical integral values. The opposite happens when, in
case of snow mass reduction, the number of levels becomes too small, in that
case the standard thickness is reduced (halved) up to the initial standard
thickness. In this way the numerical scheme allows to represent a snow cover
of arbitrary thickness, follow its thickening or thinning, while keeping the
number of layers between given limits.

coordinate in the snow layer.

\subsection{Dynamics and balance of snow mass}

The dynamics of the snow layer mass is determined by the variations of the
two components of the snow layer: solid and liquid. The variations of the
liquid component take place in presence of liquid precipitation falling and
condensation of water vapour on the top snow level and in case of snow
melting in the whole layer; in this case liquid water flows into the lower
layers or in the soil. The general balance of snow mass is determined by the
sum of the water fluxes (in all the phases) at the top and bottom layers.

The water mass flux at the top layer is described in Sect.~2 (see
Eq.~38 ($\Phi_\text{v~snow}^\mathrm{turb}$), Eqs.~41 and 43 ($\Phi
_\text{w snow}^\mathrm{liq}$), Eq.~44 ($\Phi_\text{w snow}^\mathrm{ice}$)). At the
bottom layer, the water mass flux is determined by the liquid water flux
from the layer above. The process of water draining along the snow profile
is described in the following way: all the liquid water that at the
beginning of the time step is found at level $k$, at the end of the step is
found at level $k+1$, this hypothesis is acceptable since empirical data
show that even a very small liquid water draining speed is always higher
than the values resulting from this hypothesis. The thickness of the snow
layers is in the order of centimetre and the time step is in the order of a
minute, thus all the water can drain through a layer of any reasonable
thickness a few seconds even with very low hydraulic conductivity value of
the order of 10$^{-4}$\,m\,s$^{-2}$. The liquid water flux at a half snow layer is
thus:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{m~kh}=\frac{m_{k-1}\cdot\left(
1-f_{\mathrm{ice}~k-1}^\mathrm{snow} \right)}{\Delta t},
\end{equation}
where $\Phi_{m~kh}$ is the flux of liquid water at level {kh} (kg\,m$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$),
$m_{k-1}$ is the specific (total) snow mass at level $k-1$ (kg\,m$^{-2}$),
$f_{\mathrm{ice}~k-1}^\mathrm{snow}$ is the fraction of ice phase in the total snow
mass at level $k-1$.

The water flux at the lowest snow half level is the water flux at the soil
surface (see Sect.~3).

\subsection{Processes of heat conduction and water phase transition in the snow}

As in the soil scheme, the main equation describing the thermodynamic state
of the snow is the equation of entropy transport and conservation (see
Sect.~5). In the case of snow, for solving the entropy prognostic equation
the splitting method is applied: first, the conductive entropy transport
term is solved, then the entropy conservation in case of phase transition in
the snow layer is solved.

Considering the conductive transport, in mass coordinates, the equation has
the following aspect:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial S_\mathrm{snow}^\mathrm{spec}}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial \Phi
_{S~\mathrm{snow}}}{\partial m},
\end{equation}
where $S_\mathrm{snow}^\mathrm{spec}$ is the specific entropy of snow (J\,K$^{-1}$\,kg$^{-1}$) and
$\Phi_{S~\mathrm{snow}}$ is the snow entropy flux (J\,K$^{-1}$\,m$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$).

By analogy with soil entropy (see Eqs.~60, 61) the total specific
entropy of the snow layer, including the solid and liquid phases of water,
is defined as:
\begin{equation}
S_\mathrm{snow}^\mathrm{spec}=C_\mathrm{snow}^{\Sigma }\ln\frac{T}{T_{{0}}}
,
\end{equation}
where $C_\mathrm{snow}^{\Sigma }$ is the total specific heat capacity of snow
including ice and liquid water (J\,kg$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$), which can be rewritten, by
making use of the concept of fraction of solid phase with respect to total
mass, in the following way:
\begin{equation}
C_\mathrm{snow}^{\Sigma }=f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{snow}C_\mathrm{i}+\left(
{1-}f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{snow} \right)C_\mathrm{w}.
\end{equation}
The flux of conductive entropy transport is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{S~\mathrm{snow}}=\frac{\lambda_\mathrm{snow}}{C_\mathrm{snow}^{\Sigma
}}\mathrm{\cdot }\rho_\mathrm{snow}^{\Sigma }\mathrm{\cdot }\frac{\partial
S_\mathrm{snow}^\mathrm{spec}}{\partial m},
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_\mathrm{snow}$ is the specific heat conductivity of snow (J\,s$^{-1}$\,m$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$) and $\rho_\mathrm{snow}^{\Sigma }$ is the total density of snow
including ice and liquid water (kg\,m$^{-3}$).

In this equation the density is not the density of the porous medium but it
is a virtual density of the thermodynamically active medium, excluding the
pore volume, defined as:
\begin{equation}
\rho_\mathrm{snow}^{\Sigma }=f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{snow}\rho_\mathrm{i}\mathrm{+}\left(
\mathrm{1-}f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{snow} \right)\rho_\mathrm{w}.
\end{equation}
At the same time, a density from the point of view of the porous medium is
introduced for the snow, in order to define the characteristics of heat
conductivity. This density is indicated with the symbol $\rho_\mathrm{snow}$.
This quantity is a diagnostic parameter defined at each snow layer,
depending on the thickness of the snow layer, on the snow age at each layer
and on the total period during which the snow at every layer was subject to
melting/freezing processes. The following method for determining diagnostic
snow density is proposed:
\begin{equation}
{\begin{array}{l}
 \rho_\mathrm{snow}=\min\left[ f_{2}\cdot f_{3}, \rho_\mathrm{firn}
\right]  \\
 f_{2}=\max\left\{ min\left[ \left( \frac{\tau_\mathrm{snow}^\mathrm{melt}+30}{395}
\right)^{0.3}, 1 \right]\cdot \rho_\mathrm{firn}, f_{1}
\right\} \\
 f_{1}=\max\left\{ \min\left[ \left( \frac{\tau_\mathrm{snow}}{365}
\right)^{0.3}, 1 \right]\cdot \rho_\mathrm{snow}^\mathrm{old}, \rho
_\mathrm{snow}^\mathrm{fresh} \right\} \\
 f_{3}=\min\left[ 1+0.5\left( \frac{m}{100} \right)^{0.5}, 1.5
\right]  \\
 \end{array}},
\end{equation}
where $\tau_\mathrm{snow}$ and $\tau_\mathrm{snow}^\mathrm{melt}$ are the total snow age
and the total period during which snow was subject to melting (days),
$\rho_\mathrm{firn}$, $\rho_\mathrm{snow}^\mathrm{fresh}$ and $\rho_\mathrm{snow}^\mathrm{old}$
are density of firn, of fresh snow and of old snow (kg\,m$^{-3}$), $m$ is the snow
mass in the current layer according to the vertical coordinate used (kg\,m$^{-2}$). When density is determined, a limitation is applied, according to
which the density variation cannot exceed 10\,\%\,d$^{-1}$.

The heat conductivity of snow was defined following the study of Jin et
al.~(1999):
\begin{equation}
\lambda_\mathrm{snow}{=2.45\cdot }{{10}}^{{-6}}{\cdot
}\rho_\mathrm{snow}^{{2}}.
\end{equation}
When Eq.~(73) is solved, the snow temperature including effect of heat
conduction is determined, while the solid fraction does not change and is
considered known.

We consider now the solution of the second part of the problem, i.e. the
conservation of snow entropy in case of phase transition. The following
quantity, equal to the entropy of a particular snow layer including liquid
and solid phases, should be preserved:
\begin{equation}
S_\mathrm{snow}=\Delta m\mathrm{\cdot }\left\{
f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{snow}C_\mathrm{i}\ln\frac{T}{T_{{0}}}{+}\left(
{1-}f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{snow} \right)\left(
C_\mathrm{w}\ln\frac{T}{T_{{0}}}{+}\frac{L_\mathrm{i}^\mathrm{w}}{T_{{0}}}
\right) \right\},
\end{equation}
where $S_\mathrm{snow}$ is the entropy of snow (J\,K$^{-1}$ m-2) and $\Delta m$ is the
specific mass of a snow layer (kg\,m$^{-2}$).

In order to numerically solve Eq.~(73) a discretization of the vertical
coordinate as shown in Fig.~3 is used, together with a time-explicit method
of approximation of fluxes and of their derivatives. The following
finite-difference prognostic equation is thus obtained:
\begin{equation}
\frac{C_{\mathrm{snow}~k}^{\Sigma }\ln\frac{T_{k}^{\mathrm{\ast
}}}{T_{{0}}}{-}C_{\mathrm{snow}~k}^{\Sigma
}\ln\frac{T_{k}^{{0}}}{T_{{0}}}}{\Delta t}=\rho
_{\mathrm{snow}~k}^{\Sigma }{\cdot }\frac{\frac{\lambda
_\mathrm{snow}^{kh{+1}}}{C_{\mathrm{snow}~kh{+1}}^{\Sigma
}}\frac{C_{\mathrm{snow}~k{+1}}^{\Sigma
}\ln\frac{T_{k{+1}}^{{0}}}{T_{{0}}}{-}C_{\mathrm{snow}~k}^{\Sigma
}\ln\frac{T_{k}^{{0}}}{T_{{0}}}}{m_{k{+1}}{-}m_{k}}{-}\frac{\lambda
_\mathrm{snow}^{kh}}{C_{\mathrm{snow}~kh}^{\Sigma }}\frac{C_{\mathrm{snow}~k}^{\Sigma
}\ln\frac{T_{k}^{{0}}}{T_{{0}}}{-}C_{\mathrm{snow}~k{-1}}^{\Sigma
}\ln\frac{T_{k{-1}}^{{0}}}{T_{{0}}}}{m_{k}{-}m_{k{-1}}}}{m_{kh{+1}}{-}m_{kh}},
\end{equation}
where the indexes $k$ and $k_{h}$ indicate the values on the full and half
vertical levels respectively, the upper indexes 0 and $*$ indicate the values
of temperature before and after the solution of the conductive heat
transport equation respectively. The values of the physical parameters at
half levels are computed as the arithmetic mean of the values at the
contiguous full levels. In order to compute the overall virtual density
(density used in thermodynamics) and heat capacity of snow, the value of
solid fraction of snow layer at the beginning of the time step is used.

Solution of Eq.~(81) allows to compute temperature $T^{\ast }$ after taking into
account the conductive heat transfer but without considering the phase
transition.

After having solved the first part of the split problem, which provided the
value of temperature $T^{\ast }$, it is possible to define the value of snow
entropy, which is considered the definitive value at the end of the time
step. For determining entropy, the finite different discretization of Eq.~(80)
is used:
\begin{equation}
S_{\mathrm{snow}~k}^{\Delta t}=\left\{ f_{\mathrm{ice}~k}^\mathrm{snow 0}C_\mathrm{i}ln\frac{T_{k}^{{\ast
}}}{T_{{0}}}{+}\left( {1-}f_{\mathrm{ice}~k}^\mathrm{soil0} \right)\left( C_\mathrm{w}\ln\frac{T_{k}^{\ast
}}{T_{{0}}}{+}\frac{L_\mathrm{i}^\mathrm{w}}{T_{{0}}} \right)
\right\}{\cdot }\left( m_{kh{+1}}{-}m_{kh} \right),
\end{equation}
where $f_{\mathrm{ice}~k}^\mathrm{snow0}$ is the fraction of solid phase at level $k$
before taking into account phase transitions.

Equation (82) includes two unknowns: temperature and fraction of solid
phase. Unlike the case for soil moisture, it is assumed that in the snow
layer the presence of water in liquid phase ($f_\mathrm{ice}^\mathrm{snow} < 1$)
is possible only at 0\,{\degree C} ($T=T_{0}$). This assumption simplifies
the solution: either the initial temperature is $T_{0}$, then Eq.~(82)
has a single unknown, i.e. fraction of solid phase, or the initial
temperature is below zero, then the only unknown is temperature which has to
be below or equal to 0\,{\degree}C. The temperature and fraction of solid
phase determined in this way are considered final at the end of the time
step.

As remarked in Sect.~5, the solution of the thermodynamic state of snow
layer is performed only when the amount of snow exceeds a given threshold in
order to avoid numerical problems. If the snow specific mass is below the
given threshold, its thermodynamic state is described by the solution of the
entropy equation at the top soil level, whose entropy is augmented by the
value of entropy for snow.

Solution of Eq.~(82) allows to diagnose the length of the time interval
during which the snow is exposed to melting. The value of this interval is
required for computing snow density.

In conclusion, the scheme of snow-layer processes defines the overall
specific snow mass, and its distribution along the vertical levels.
Furthermore, it defines at each level temperature, fraction of solid phase,
snow age, length of melting time-interval and snow density.

\section{Verification of ``Pochva'' scheme in NWP model Bolam in hindcast regime}

The ``Pochva'' scheme, described above, was developed for use in numerical
atmospheric models as a parameterisation of heat and water exchange
processes at the surface. However, it can be also applied in a column
variant using observational data on energy and water fluxes at the surface.
Such application allows for studies of soil physical parameters, as well as
for testing the scheme itself. The results of such testing using
observations from the Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observation Project
Baltic Sea Experiment (BALTEX) are presented in the Appendix~A.

The ``Pochva'' scheme is available as free and open source software and it
has been implemented in a way that makes it easily adaptable to any
atmospheric model. The input data required are atmospheric variables at the
lowest level, together with fluxes of precipitation, visible and infrared
radiation, heat and humidity (or variables allowing to compute these
fluxes). Besides these variables, quantities defining the physical
characteristics of soil and vegetation are required. Soil characteristics
are allowed to vary along the vertical direction as well. In ``Pochva'' the
bottom boundary condition for temperature and soil moisture can be specified
through a ``climatological level'', with a horizontally-varying depth,
depending on the local climatological and hydrological conditions, at which
the values of temperature and moisture content are considered constant. The
description of the methods used to define the physical parameters of soil
and vegetation and the method to define the climatological level may be the
subject of a future task. Here we remark that the spatial variability of
soil physical parameters has been defined on the basis of the FAO dataset
(FAO Unesco, 1997), the vegetation types and the corresponding physical
parameters have been defined using the GLC2000 dataset (Joint Research
Centre, 2003). Regarding the definition of the climatological levels, these
have been set through the analysis of air temperature at 2\,m above the
surface for the period 1979--2014 from ECMWF ERA Interim dataset and the FAO
soil type dataset.

In order to test the implementation, the ``Pochva'' scheme has been included
in the NWP model ``Bolam'' (Buzzi et al., 1994, 1998) and in
its global variant ``Globo'' (Malguzzi et al., 2011). Bolam is a hydrostatic
NWP model on a limited area. A numerical experiment in hindcast regime has
been set up with Bolam, the experiment consisted in a continuous integration
of the model on a long period using objective analysis data as boundary
conditions during the whole period. As initial and boundary conditions, data
from the ECMWF IFS model have been used from the ECMWF operational archive.
The model domain covered most of the European territory. The time extent of
the experiment covered the period June 2013--November 2015, with the first
six months being used to allow the soil layer to reach the thermodynamic
equilibrium with the climatological bottom boundary conditions.
Consequently, these six months were excluded from the subsequent analysis of
the results. In this way the effective period includes two full years, from
the beginning of December 2013 to the end of November 2015. The length of
two years was chosen in order to exclude the presence of interannual
oscillations and trends in the simulations.

In order to verify the results, data from standard meteorological
observations from WMO GTS network have been used, retrieved from ECMWF
archive. The main purpose of the numerical experiment was to evaluate the
contribution of the ``Pochva'' scheme to the numerical modelling results,
thus the variables used in the verification process were the air temperature
and the dew-point temperature at 2\,m above the surface.

The experiment show that the main scores, such as mean error (bias) and root
mean square error (RMSE), of near-surface temperature and humidity,
stratified on monthly and seasonal intervals do not vary significantly among
the two simulated years. This suggests that there is no significant trend
due to error accumulation in the simulation. In the following, scores
averaged on seasonal intervals based on the two simulated years are shown.

Figures~4 and 5 show seasonal averages of temperature bias and RMSE over
observation points. As it can be seen from Fig.~4, the bias obtained is
relatively low, mostly between $-$1 and $+$1\,{\degree}C. A
higher error is noticed in the cold seasons (winter, autumn), when Central
Europe experiences bias values between $-$1 and $-$3\,{\degree}C
(up to $-$5\,{\degree}C in mountainous areas) while at the east of Ural range
the bias sign is opposite ($+$1, $+$2\,{\degree}C\blackbox{Please confirm change.}). In the warm
seasons, mainly in summer, a bias up to $+$5\,{\degree}C is noticed in the
desert or semi-arid areas of Eastern Mediterranean.

%f6
Figure. 5. Seasonally averaged RMSE of temperature at 2\,m above surface at
observation points: \textbf{(a)}~winter, \textbf{(b)}~spring, \textbf{(c)}~summer, \textbf{(d)}~autumn.

The RMSE shown in Fig.~5 also indicates that, on the background of an error
with a magnitude of 2--3\,{\degree}C, the error is higher in the colder
seasons especially in mountain and continental areas, up to 5\,{\degree}C.
In general, coastal areas show lower RMSE, with values lower than
2\,{\degree}C, growing up to 3--5\,{\degree}C with increasing distance from
the sea.

It can be concluded that the overall near-surface atmospheric thermal regime
is simulated with enough accuracy. The errors in the cold periods in
continental and mountain areas can be attributed to a poor simulation of the
snow cover, which strongly influences the near-surface temperature, while
high errors in desert areas during the warm periods can either be due to an
error in the soil surface temperature or to an inaccurate representation of
surface turbulent exchange in cases of dry thermal instability.

Fig. 6 shows the seasonal dew-point temperature bias on observation points.
In the cold seasons the systematic error is in the interval -1\,{\degree}C
$+$2\,{\degree}C, while in the warm seasons the dew-point temperature (and
thus air humidity) is overestimated in the continental areas, with a bias
growing up to $+$3\,{\degree}C $+$5\,{\degree}C with increasing distance
from the sea. Similar conclusions may be drawn from the analysis of seasonal
RMSE, presented in fig. 7. In the coastal areas all year round and anywhere
in the colder seasons, RMSE has low or moderate values, 1-3\,{\degree}C,
while in the continental areas in the warm seasons it may grow up to
5\,{\degree}C and more. It can thus be noticed that most of the RMSE is
explained by the bias. The overestimation of air humidity in the continental
areas during warm seasons is difficult to explain. The absence of a
corresponding systematic error for temperature suggests that it is not due
to an overestimation of evaporation, since, if that were the case,
temperature would have been underestimated. It can be assumed that this is
due to inaccuracy in the definition of water vapour fluxes or of the
humidity profile in the surface layer in the warm season, i.e. in cases of
neutral or unstable stratification.

For a more detailed examination of the errors in near-surface air
temperature and humidity from the point of view of the representation of
daily cycle, the simulated and observed values for these variables at all
the observation times are shown here, averaged on each season and on
specific geographical areas. Since the model domain covers areas with
completely different meteorological and climatological characteristics, the
geographical averaging has been carried out considering climatologically
uniform areas. For this purpose, a dataset of the K\"{o}ppen-Geiger climate
classification has been used (Rubel and Kottek, 2010). Most of the
observation points falls into six climatic areas according to the
K\"{o}ppen-Geiger classification, namely Bsk (cold steppe), Cfa (humid
subtropical), Cfb (temperate oceanic), Csa (hot-summer Mediterranean), Dfb
(warm-summer humid continental), Dfc (subarctic). Furthermore, a separate
treatment was adopted for points on mountainous areas, defined as points
whose altitude exceeds 1000m above the mean sea level. Fig. 8 shows the
distribution of observation points by climatic zone.

Figure 8. Distribution of observation points by climatic zone according to
K\"{o}ppen-Geiger classification.

For all the observation points falling in each of the seven main climatic
zones, bias and RMSE of temperature and dew-point temperature at 2 m above
surface have been computed at all the times of the day at which observations
are available, namely 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 UTC. Below, the error
obtained in the representation of the daily cycle in each climatic zone will
be examined.

In winter period (fig. 9 and 10), the error does not depend on the time of
the day in all the climatic zones except in the mountainous areas, where the
error is higher during the day. In most of the climatic zones, the error is
mostly due to bias, which is quite low, -1.3\,{\degree}C -1\,{\degree}C,
while RMSE is in the range 1-4\,{\degree}C. Error is lower in the oceanic
climate areas and it increases in areas with a continental climate. The zone
with subarctic climate stands out from this picture, since it is
characterised by low bias (-1.5\,{\degree}C) and high RMSE
(4.5-5\,{\degree}C). At the same time, the mountainous areas, characterised
by a similar cold climate, show good scores. This suggests that there are
some problems with surface albedo definition in subarctic area and further
studies are needed.

Figure 10. Same as figure 9 but for RMSE of simulated air temperature at 2 m
above surface.

During the summer period (fig. 9 and 10), all the climatic zones are
characterised by a relatively low RMSE (2-4\,{\degree}C), mostly explained
by bias, which oscillates between -1.5\,{\degree}C and $+$1\,{\degree}C.
Bias is higher during daytime in ``hot summer Mediterranean'' climate. This
could be possibly due to some problems in the representation of the surface
sensible heat flux in the presence of an unstable surface layer, or in the
surface latent heat flux, or due to the insufficient heat capacity of the
higher soil layer which, in turn, could be due to too low values of soil
moisture. In areas with mountain and subarctic climate, the score is
significantly better in summer than in winter. This is possibly due to
deficiencies in the representation of snow cover or of the radiative
characteristics of the snow cover itself.

In the spring and autumn periods, (fig. 9 and 10, panels b and d) the scores
for 2-m temperature have intermediate values between those for summer and
winter. The overall scores are good, the bias ranges between -1.5\,{\degree}C and $+$1.5\,{\degree}C, while RMSE is around 2-4\,{\degree}C. In spring
the error characteristics are closer to the summer ones, while in autumn
they are closer to the winter ones. It is probably the case that the
processes of formation and melting of the snow layer in the areas with a
stable winter snow cover (warm-summer humid continental, subarctic and
mountains) are simulated more or less correctly, since no increase of the
error is observed in these transitional seasons.

Concerning the scores for humidity in terms of 2 m dew-point temperature,
figures 11 and 12 show the daily cycle of the bias and RMSE for this
variable.

In the winter period (fig. 11 and 12, panel a) all the climatic zones are
characterised by a low systematic error (0\,{\degree}C $+$2\,{\degree}C)
and a significant RMSE (2-5\,{\degree}C) with a very weak daily cycle. In
the same way as for temperature, the scores strongly depend on the climatic
zone: better scores (RMSE up to 3\,{\degree}C) are found in the area with
oceanic climate (temperate oceanic, hot-summer Mediterranean, humid
subtropical), while the worst scores (RMSE higher than 4\,{\degree}C) are
found in zones with cold continental climate (warm-summer humid continental,
subarctic, mountains). This may be attributed to deficiencies in the
definition of latent heat flux or air humidity profile over snow layer, i.e.
in cases of stable surface layer.

In the summer period, on the other hand, most of the RMSE
(2.5-8.5\,{\degree}C) is explained by systematic error (0\,{\degree}C
$+$6\,{\degree}C) which is always positive, i.e. the air humidity is
systematically overestimated. In general, the minimum of daily error occurs
at daytime, while it is maximum in the evening and night. This may be due to
a suboptimal tuning of the turbulent exchange parameterisation in neutral
and stable boundary layer conditions. In the areas characterised by oceanic
climate or in cold climate areas (temperate oceanic, subarctic) the errors
are lower, while in dry areas (cold steppe) they are higher. At the time of
day when errors are higher, the overestimation of air humidity is
accompanied by underestimation of air temperature. This may be an evidence
of deficiencies in the computation of latent heat flux (evaporation).

During the spring and autumn seasons (fig. 11 and 12, panels b, d) the dew
point temperature scores, similarly to the case of temperature, exhibit
intermediate values between those found in winter and summer seasons. In
general, the air humidity is almost always overestimated, more so in the
warm season than in the cold season.

Figure 12. Same as figure 11 but for RMSE of simulated dew-point temperature
at 2 m above surface.

The scores presented here show no evidence of systematic deficiencies in the
near-surface temperature, except during periods characterised by a stable
snow cover, when temperature is systematically underestimated, or during
summer periods in dry climatic zones when daytime temperature is
overestimated. At the same time, near-surface air humidity is systematically
overestimated, especially in summer time, and, in particular, in dry
climatic areas in the evening and at night.

As a general conclusion the results shown by the numerical experiments with
the ``Pochva'' scheme are definitely convincing.

8 Summary

The model of hydro-thermal processes in vegetated soil and snow cover
presented in this work is characterised by a special attention to the
soil-water phase transition, and by novel approaches to define some soil and
snow physical parameters. The proposed model has been validated by a solid
verification presented in this work, consisting in a two year hindcast
experiment. The presented model may be useful for modelling research over
polar or cold climate zones, in permafrost evolution studies, in studies and
forecast of snow cover, in studies of the surface layer in stable conditions
over cold surfaces. The model is realized using an effective and stable
numerical algorithm with a clear, intuitive interface that allows a simple
coupling to an atmospheric model or to observations of energy and water
fluxes in the air surface layer and at the surface.

This land model has been included in the CNR-ISAC NWP models: Globo
(hydrostatic approximation, global domain), Bolam, described above, and
Moloch (non-hydrostatic, high space resolution at limited area). The

Protection Department of Italy. Forecast products are available at

Appendix A

A test of ``Pochva'' scheme in its column version has been performed using
observational data of Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observation Project
(CEOP) Baltic Sea Experiment (BALTEX). The observed data have been used as
forcing parameters for ``Pochva'' simulation, for determining the physical
parameters of soil profile and for defining the initial condition. The
observed data have also been used for the verification of simulation
results. The observations were carried out at Falkenberg, a site of the
German Weather Service Meteorological Observatory. This site is located in
grassland fields, in a heterogeneous rural landscape typical for Central
Europe. The observational data are freely available upon individual request.

To apply the soil scheme offline, the values of the soil physical parameters
and the soil temperature and water content profiles must be defined at the
beginning of the simulation; top and bottom conditions for the prognostic
variables must be defined for each time step during the simulation. A time
step of 60 s was used in the simulation. Values of soil physical parameters
in Pochva simulation have been defined following the values measured at the
observation point and presented in table A1 taken from dataset documentation
(Beyrich, BALTEX: Lindenberg Soil Temperature and Soil Moisture Data Set,
2011). The initial condition for prognostic variables, soil temperature and
soil water content can be defined using the measurements at the soil levels.
The bottom boundary conditions for prognostic variables can be defined using
observation data at the lowest measurement level interpolated in time. The
top boundary condition for prognostic variables, surface temperature,
surface air humidity, surface soil water content, can be defined by heat and
water mass fluxes at the surface: radiation flux (global net and visible
incident), sensible and latent heat flux, precipitation flux and water
vapour flux. The indicated surface fluxes have to be defined using the
measurement data at the surface and in the air surface layer.

The observation dataset contains measurement for the following variables:
soil temperature at 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.30, 0.45, 0.50, 0.60, 0.90,
1.00, 1.20, 1.50 m depth, specific volumetric soil water content at 0.08,
0.15, 0.30, 0.45, 0.60, 0.90 m depth, pressure and temperature at the
surface, air temperature and air humidity at 2.4 m above the surface, wind
at 10 m above the surface, pressure, air temperature, air humidity and wind
at 40 and 80 m above the surface, downward and upward short-wave and
long-wave solar radiation at the surface, precipitation at the surface,
sensible and latent heat flux 2.4 m above the surface. These data are
presented in (Beyrich, BALTEX: Lindenberg Soil Temperature and Soil Moisture
Data Set, 2011), (Beyrich, BALTEX: Lindenberg Meteorological Tower Data Set,
2011).

To avoid vertical interpolation of simulated data when comparing with
observations, the Pochva simulation uses the same soil levels where soil
temperature and water content measurements are available, namely: 0.02,
0.05, 0.08, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.30, 0.45, 0.50, 0.60, 0.90, 1.00, 1.20, 1.50
m depth. The bottom condition for soil temperature is defined at 1.5m depth
using the bottom temperature measurement level, whereas the bottom condition
for soil water content is defined at 0.9 m depth using the bottom
measurement level for this parameter. Since the lower boundaries for the
prognostic variables in these simulations are not deep, a few days of
simulation may be sufficient to reach the numerical thermodynamic
equilibrium regime.

The indicated measurement list contains all the parameters required for
defining the top soil boundary condition. These parameters are also named
``atmospheric forcing parameters''. They are the following: sensible and
latent heat flux at 2.4 m above the surface, downward and upward short-wave
and long-wave radiation at the surface, precipitation at the surface (water
vapour flux at the surface cat be estimated using observed latent heat
flux).

Table A1. Physical parameters of the soil at the Lindenberg - Falkenberg
observation station adapted from (Beyrich, BALTEX: Lindenberg Soil
Temperature and Soil Moisture Data Set, 2011).

The observation datasets contain the data for the period
01/01/2002-31/12/2009. All observed data have time resolution equal to 30
minutes. The author has developed a program that reads data from the
database for various parameters, identifies the times at which data for all
the atmospheric forcing parameters are available, and produces a list of the
times found. Another program finds periods without gaps in the obtained
list. A third program searches in the database the measurements for all
required forcing parameters within the periods of continuous measurements,
interpolates these data in time with the step specified for the model
simulation (60 s) and prepares all necessary data for the Pochva simulation.

Unfortunately, this search revealed very frequent gaps in the measurements
of surface heat fluxes. A search for periods with gaps of no more than two
hours for all the required forcing parameters resulted in 90 periods, the
longest of which had a length of 4 days. However, if heat fluxes are
excluded from the search of continuous measurement periods, then a very long
period of 913 days is found. Therefore, the author decided to perform two
types of simulations: one exclusively with the ``Pochva'' model using all
atmospheric forcing parameters from measurements, the other with the
``Pochva'' model coupled with a model of air surface layer processes, which
simulates surface heat fluxes using measurements of wind, pressure, air
temperature, air humidity at a height of 40 m above the ground level and at
the surface.

The author selected two periods for the first type of Pochva simulations,
one in summer and one in winter. The initial conditions have been defined
using the observational data at the date and time of the simulation start.
The simulation results and their comparison with the observational data are
presented below.

The summer verification period is 01/07/2003 23:00 -- 04/07/2003 04:30 (53.5
hours). Input data on energy fluxes at the surface and water mass fluxes are
shown in figure A1.

Figure A1. Observation data (BALTEX) in Falkenberg 2-3 July 2003, parameters
at the surface: (a) solar radiation and heat fluxes (W m$^{-2}$); (b)
precipitation and evaporation rate (kg m$^{-2}$ hour$^{-1}$).

These July days are characterised by intensive net radiation flux
accompanied by moderate sensible and latent heat fluxes, latent heat flux is
significant only after light rain in the first day.

The simulated soil temperature and moisture data are shown in figures A2 and
A3 together with observed data at the same depth levels.

(d) -0.60 m.

water content (m3 m-3) at various depths: (a) -0.08 m; (b) -0.15 m; (c)
-0.60 m.

Figures A2 and A3 show that the simulated soil parameters at the different
levels are out of numerical equilibrium. Despite this fact, the simulated
parameter values are close to the observed values. The soil temperature
simulated at various levels shows a correct daily cycle especially at the
surface and at the top soil levels, which are important for an atmospheric
model parameterisation. Moreover, the observation data show some odd
characteristics: a light rain was observed on 02/07 at 12:30 (fig. A1(b))
accompanied by a sharp decrease in solar incoming radiation flux and an
increase in outgoing latent heat flux, thus determining a strongly negative
energy budget at the surface. This phenomenon is simulated by Pochva, the
simulated surface and soil top temperature evidently drop at this time,
while, on the other hand, the observed surface and soil top temperature do
not reflect this phenomenon. Furthermore, the observed soil moisture at
different levels remains unchanged despite the presence of significant
vertical gradient of soil moisture, rain and evaporation in the observation
data.

The winter verification period is 08/01/2005 17:30 -- 12/01/2005 12:30 (91
hours). Input data on energy fluxes at the surface and water mass fluxes are
shown in figure A4.

Figure A4. Observation data (BALTEX) in Falkenberg 8-12 January 2005,
parameters at the surface: (a) solar radiation and heat fluxes (W m$^{-2}$);
(b) precipitation and evaporation rate (kg m$^{-2}$ hour$^{-1}$).

This January period is characterised by intensive net radiation flux during
the first and second days with significant daytime heating and night-time
cooling, accompanied by weak sensible and latent heat fluxes except for the
first night, when a significant sensible heat flux is observed; latent heat
flux is significant only after light rain in the first day. Some episodes of
very light precipitation occur. The evaporation flux has small values.

The simulated soil and moisture data at same depth levels are presented in
figures A5 and A6 together with observed data.

water content (m3 m-3) at various depths: (a) -0.08 m; (b) -0.15 m; (c)
-0.60 m.

In this winter case the initial condition for the soil temperature has a
very small vertical gradient. For this reason, the simulated results do not
show numerical unbalance. The simulated soil temperature is very close to
observed values. At the same time, the initial condition for soil moisture
has a significant vertical gradient following observed data. Thus, the
simulated soil moisture has the characteristics of numerical disequilibrium,
similarly to the summer case. However, in this case the observed moisture
has an odd behaviour, it remains almost constant at all vertical levels. The
observed soil moisture data indicate that water conductivity is close to
zero, but it does not correspond to the conductivity value declared for the
observation point (see table A1). Probably, there are some measurement
inaccuracies.

To summarise, it can be said that Pochva scheme is able to simulate the soil
temperature and moisture enough correctly. The observed values of soil
physical parameters, of forcing scheme parameters and of initial condition
parameters have been used in Pochva simulations with no manipulation, and
simulations show results close to observation data.

The second type of Pochva simulation has been performed for the period
03/07/2007 03:00 -- 31/12/2009 23:30 (912.85 days), which includes almost 3
years. The sensible heat, latent heat and water vapour fluxes at the surface
have not been taken from measurements but simulated by an air surface layer
process model based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (Monin and Obukhov,
1955) using wind, air temperature and air humidity observations at 40 m
above the surface and at the surface. The simulation results and their
comparison with the observation data are presented below.

Input data on energy fluxes at the surface and water mass fluxes are shown
in figure A7, the simulated soil temperature and moisture data at same depth
levels are shown in figures A8 and A9 together with observed data.

m-3) at various depths: (a) -0.08 m; (b) -0.15 m; (c) -0.60 m for the period
3 July 2007 -- 31 December 2009.

Figures A7-A9 show a well-defined seasonal cycle of the surface and soil
parameters. Periods with very hot and with very cold weather, as well as
periods with precipitation, are present in the observed data. As it can be
seen in figures A8 and A9, unfortunately, at temperatures below 0\,{\degree}C, the soil temperature and soil water content sensors did not operate in
both winters. However, the surface temperature sensor operated during the
whole simulation period.

Figures A8 and A9 show that the simulated values for various parameters are
close to the observed values. The surface temperature is very close to the
observed values (fig. A8a), this means that Pochva and the air surface layer
schemes approximate the energy flux surface equilibrium very well. This is
very important because the main task of the Pochva scheme is to correctly
simulate the thermal state of the surface for use in a numerical atmosphere
model. The simulation of the soil temperature in the middle levels has some
problems with underestimation (by 3-5~\,{\degree}C) in the summer months
(figs. A8b, A8c), this error is also noticeable in the deep layer (fig.
A8d), but less pronounced (2-3\,{\degree}C). During winter months, when
the surface temperature is mostly between 0 and -20\,{\degree}C, the
simulation of soil temperature is correct at all soil levels. The soil water
content in the upper layer is mostly correctly simulated (fig. A9a), except
for August 2008 and 2009 and October 2008 and 2009 when soil moisture at 8
cm depth was overestimated. At the same time, the soil water content in the
deeper layer was simulated correctly (fig. A9c).

In summary, it can be noted that Pochva scheme simulates correctly the
temperature and water content of the soil in the upper and lower soil layers
in all seasons, but in the middle layer only in the cold season, while in
the warm season it underestimates the temperature of this layer and
overestimates the water content.
