## Reservoir release

The reservoir release at day $t$ is partitioned in a component based on the hedged demand ($\hat{D}_t$) and a component based on the inflow ($I_t$):

$$Q_t = \rho \cdot \kappa_t \cdot \hat{D}_t + (1 - \rho) \cdot I_t$$

The partition coefficient ($\rho$) depends on the degree of regulation of the reservoir ($DOR$), i.e., the ratio between the reservoir storage capacity and the annual inflow. The release of highly regulated reservoirs ($DOR \geq DOR*$) depends only on the demand component ($\rho = 1$), whereas in the rest of the cases the release depends on both the demand and the current inflow components:

$$\rho = min\left(1, \left( \frac{DOR}{DOR*} \right)^\beta \right)$$

$DOR*$ and $\beta$ are model parameters in mHM. Shin et al. (2019) and Hanasaki et al. (2006) used fixed values as reported in Table 1.

In the release formulation, the current filling ($V_t$) of the reservoir is used indirectly to limit the supplied demand by the time varying coefficient $\kappa_t$:

$$\kappa_t = \left( \frac{V_t}{\gamma \cdot V} \right) ^\lambda = \left( \frac{V_t}{V_n} \right) ^\lambda$$

where $V_n$ is the normal filling of the reservoir (mHM estimates this value with the parameter $\gamma$), and $\lambda$ is a parameter that further controls demand hedging. Again, Shin et al. (2019) and Hanasaki et al. (2006) used fixed values for $\gamma$ and $\lambda$ (see Table 1).

## Demand hedging

The hedged demand ($\hat{D}_t$) is a transformation of the actual daily demand ($D_t$) based on the average inflow ($\overline{I}$) and average demand ($\overline{D}$). The $\omega$ parameter represents the excess of water with repect to demands and it is used to classify reservoirs in water-stressed or non-water-stressed.

In reservoirs with high water stress ($\frac{\overline{D}}{\overline{I}} \gt 1 - \omega$), the hedged demand is a combination of a fixed percentage of the mean inflow, and a varying term depending on the ratio between the current and the average demand.

$$\hat{D}_t = \omega \cdot \overline{I} + \left( 1 - \omega \right) \frac{D_t}{\overline{D}} \cdot \overline{I}$$

In reservoirs with lower water stress ($\frac{\overline{D}}{\overline{I}} \lt 1 - \omega$), the hedged demand is the average surplus of inflow plus the current demand. This means 

$$\hat{D}_t = \overline{I} - \overline{D} + D_t$$

mHM considers $\omega$ a model parameter, but previous studies used fixed values (see Table 1).

> **Note**. The demand is further hedged in the computation of the reservoir release depending on the current filling of the reservoirs ($\kappa_t$)
