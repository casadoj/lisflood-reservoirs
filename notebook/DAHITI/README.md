To use the notebook [_download_API_v2.ipynb_](./download_API_v2.ipynb) you need to files in the same directory as the notebook:

1. A text file ([_api_key.txt_](./api_key.txt)) containing your personal API key. Once you're logged in, you can request your API key in this [link](https://dahiti.dgfi.tum.de/en/frequently-asked-questions/api-key/).
2. A YML file ([arguments.yml](./arguments.yml)) with the arguments used to filter the targets. You can select targets based on continent, country, basin, a bounding box, or type of point.
