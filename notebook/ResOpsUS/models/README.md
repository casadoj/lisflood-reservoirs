# ResOpsUS: model development & comparison

* [ ] The notebooks called _5.*_simulation_{MODEL}.ipynb_  are test runs of each reservoir routine. Now they could all be integrated into a single notebook in which the configuration file defines the reservoir routine to be used and the function `lisfloodreservoirs.models.get_model()` instanciates the correct routine.

* [ ] All the notebooks called _6.*_{MODEL}*.ipynb_ are calibrations (or comparisons of calibration) for the different reservoir routines and univariate (storage or outflow) or bivariate (storage and outflow) calibrations. They can all be fused into a single file now; the configuration file must identify the calibration algorithm (SCE-US or MC), the target variables and the reservoir routine to be used. The function `lisfloodreservoirs.calibrations.get_calibrator()` uses these parameters to instanciate the correct calibration.
