# ResOpsUS: model development & comparison

This folder contains notebooks used for developing/testing the simulation and calibration of the reservoir routines in the repository. On top of that, there are notebooks analysing the results of the simulations and calibrations of the different routines.

* The first set of notebooks (_1_simulate*.ipynb_) are used to run the reservoir routines with default parameters.

* The second set of notebooks (_2_calibrate*.ipynb_) are used to calibrate the reservoir routines.

* The third and last set of notebooks (_3_compare*.ipynb_) analyse the results of the previous runs and calibrations.
